Walters Art Museum Collections API (Beta)
=========================================

## Get Exhibitions 

An exhibition is an organized presentation and display of a selection of museum objects. Exhibitions usually occur within the Walters Art Museum, but can also be held at other museums, galleries, etc. For each exhibition, the associated museum objects listed will be from the Walters collection. Although exhibitions frequently include objects from other institutions, those are not listed here. In addition to this API, [exhibition catalog publications and other museum publications](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AWalters+Art+Museum+%28Baltimore%2C+Md.%29&qt=hot_author) are also useful resources for studying Walters' exhibitions.
