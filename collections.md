Walters Art Museum Collections API (Beta)
===========

# Collections

Collections are one of the [5 objects you can get with the Walters API](https://github.com/WaltersArtMuseum/walters-api#overview). A collection is a group of pieces of art, artifacts, or similar items within the Walters Art Museum. Collections at the Walters are grouped by primarily by culture and sometimes by date. 
For example, the Asian Art collection contains items such as paintings, sculptures and ceramics that were made in or around the Asian continent.
