## Get Objects by Location

```
GET v1/museum/locations/{id}/objects
```

The `GET v1/museum/locations/{id}/objects` request will get museum objects that are located within a museum location, such as one of its galleries. The request accepts a number of parameters, listed below.


## Parameters
Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`apikey` | `string` | This parameter is required to be defined in every API request. Please [obtain an API key](http://api.thewalters.org/) and include it in your API requests as follows: `http://api.thewalters.org/v1/objects?apikey=<your_api_key>`. Be sure to replace `<your_api_key>` with your actual key. 
`id` | `integer` | Define this parameter in the request URI. Enter the ID of a collection to return all the artworks, artifacts or items in that collection. For example, `http://api.thewalters.org/v1/locations/3/objects` will return the museum objects associated with museum location number 3.
`Page` | `integer` | Define this parameter in the request URI. Results are returned in paged sets. By default, the page parameter is set to 1 so that the results will show the first page of results. Change this number to return other pages. For example, `http://api.thewalters.org/v1/locations/2/objects?page=3` for page 3. 
`pageSize` | `integer` | Define this parameter in the request URI. By default page size is 25 results. Change this number to alter the number of results per page. For example `http://api.thewalters.org/v1/locations/2/objects?pageSize=100` would produce a page with 100 results.
