    "Description": "Daubigny's loose, spontaneous brushwork and rich use of color provide a direct link with the work of the impressionists. Like his younger colleagues, he was also regularly criticized for producing mere \"impressions\" rather than more detailed, polished views of nature. This vibrantly colored scene dates from 1874, the year of the first impressionist exhibition. \r\n",
