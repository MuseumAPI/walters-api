    "Description": "By the time Miller saw the fur trade, several famous personalities were involved, such as Jim Bridger, \"Bourgeois\" Walker, and Kit Carson.  Of that group, it is interesting to note, Miller painted a portrait only of Walker.  There are various other portraits of members of Stewart's group, such as Pierre, a seventeen-year old French Canadian and one of Miller's favorites.  Dressed here in his buckskin shirt, his hat decorated with turkey feathers and a fox-tail brush, and holding his treasured pipe, Pierre is apparently deep in thought.  -Extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
