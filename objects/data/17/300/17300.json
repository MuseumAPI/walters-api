    "Description": "Alfred Vickers, a self-taught landscape painter, worked in a sketchy, loose technique using distinctively bright, fresh colors. Though known primarily for his coastal marines painted on the Isle of Wight and his views of Wales, Vickers traveled through much of England recording the countryside. In this work, a river falls rapidly through hilly countryside, passing beneath a bridge. At a pool in the left foreground, cattle are being watered. There are several buildings with smoking chimneys on both banks of the river.",
