    "Description": "The Egyptians used a variety of special objects to perform the rituals for the gods. The image of a special collar, called an \"usekh,\" surmounted by the head of a god or goddess was such an object (also called an \"aegis,\" originally a Greek term for \"shield\"). It was used to invoke the gods to guarantee protection, and was also used as an ornament on the bow and stern of a sacred ship. \r\n\r\nThis bronze \"usekh\" is combined with the head of a goddess, which is crowned by a \"calathos\" with \"uraei\" (cobra serpents), cow horns, and a sun-disk. This crown was originally related to Hathor, but later was also used for Isis. The collar itself displays floral ornaments and has two falcon-head terminals. This heavy bronze \"usekh\" was probably attached to the bow of a wooden sacred boat.",
