    "Description": "Christ is depicted as \"The Man of Sorrows,\" meaning that he is shown after his death, with the wounds from the crucifixion, but his eyes are open. Because Christ was believed to be both fully human and fully god, he continues to suffer for all sinners even after his death. He is supported by his mother and the apostle John as he rises from the tomb. \r\n\r\nMichele de Matteo was from Bologna, but in the late 1440s he worked in Siena and was influenced by the figural types of Giovanni di Paolo.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 131, p. 198.",
