    "Description": "In the Roman writer Ovid's tale of the unfortunate Actaeon, the hunter accidentally came across Diana, the chaste goddess of the moon and the hunt, and her nymphs bathing in a forest lake.  No mortal was permitted to see Diana naked and live.  She transformed Actaeon into a stag, and he was torn apart by his own hunting dogs.  In this statuette, only the head of the fallen Actaeon has taken on its animal shape.\r\n\r\nAlthough small, this figure group displays remarkably complex movement that is directed both toward and away from its center.  This dynamism is characteristic of the baroque style and contributes to the statuette's appeal.\r\n",
