The Child holds in his right hand a bunch of fruit taken from the circular basket proffered by the young St. John. At the right, St. Joseph leans on his staff. Above the group a swag of drapery is thrown over a tree. The background is a sky dotted with tiny sprays of light. At the base is a panel painted in gilt scrolls on a black ground with, at the extreme right, the signature: I L with a fleur-de-lys between.",
