    "Description": "This armor is engraved all over with a design based on an M, signifying the duchy of Medina Sidonia. It was made for Don Alonso Perez de Guzman el Bueno, duke of Medina Sidonia (1550-1615). Extremely rich, he was also commander of the Spanish fleet (the Armada) under King Philip II (father of the Archduchess Isabella, Spanish governor of the Southern Netherlands).\r\n\r\nThe background is darkened to contrast with the raised, partially gilded decoration. This armor was for use on horseback on the battlefield or for tournament jousting; on the right side of the breastplate are holes for bolting a lance rest. This \"suit\" was originally complemented by other pieces so that different combinations could be used for combat and sport. In the late 1500s, Milan, ruled by Spain (with the duke of Medina Sidonia as its captain-general), was one of the great European centers of armor making.\r\n",
