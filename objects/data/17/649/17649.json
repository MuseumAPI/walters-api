    "Description": "Saint Anthony was a 3rd-century hermit in Egypt. Late in life he reported that when he was young and living in a tomb away from human habitations he was attacked by horrible demons in animal forms, presumably the bedevilment of sexual tensions. Here he is barely visible in his rough shelter; the focus is on amusingly ingenious monsters, as the cow with butterfly wings. Though these lack the malevolence of Bosch's early 16th-century demons, they nevertheless reflect a belief in the supernatural forces of evil.\r\n\r\nHans Savery, who worked chiefly in Utrecht, initially with his uncle Roelandt Savery, took animal painting (one of the specialties of his uncle) into the realm of the monstrous. The mysterious, translucent fish that spits out other fish is characteristic of his work.",
