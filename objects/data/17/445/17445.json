    "Description": "This manuscript contains liturgical music to be sung during processions. It is exceptional because of its \"album\" format (10 x 14.5 cm), which is in part the result of a severe cropping of the folios. The book was made in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century in Germany. Its continued use is evident from the seventeenth- or eighteenth-century addition of paper folios containing prayers and music. Music is written in Gothic notation on three five-line staves per folio. The first folio is illuminated with a foliate initial for the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin.",
