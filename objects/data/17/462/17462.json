    "Description": "This panel, a pair with Walters 46.41, was once part of a larger program of decoration at the cathedral in Soissons that was paid for by King Philippe August of France (r. 1180-1223). It shows Habbakuk seated and dressed in an Antique robe. He holds a scroll, a common feature in medieval depictions of prophets.\r\n\r\nThis window was probably placed below figures of the apostles, visually demonstrating the Christian belief that the New Testament relied on and superseded the foundation of the Old Testament.",
