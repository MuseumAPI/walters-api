    "Description": "The Lysippides Painter is renowned for his work with another vase-painter, the Andokides Painter. They produced remarkable \"bilingual\" vases on which the Lysippides Painter painted one side in the black-figure technique, and the Andokides Painter painted the same image in the newly developed red-figure technique on the other side. On this vase, however, we have an example of the Lysippides Painter's early work in black-figure. On the front, Hermes escorts a woman towards the wine-god, Dionysus, whose satyr and maenad companions stand behind. On the back is a typical \"departure scene,\" in which an armed warrior mounts his chariot as companions see him off.",
