    "Description": "This box, carved and tooled with an overall vegetal motif, is mounted with iron bands which have openings for straps.  Messenger boxes were bound like this for added security.  Once locked and sealed, the box could have been strapped onto a saddle.\r\n\r\nThe leather was boiled (\"cuir boulli\" in French) to be made malleable enough to be fitted over a form (here a wooden box) and stamped more easily.",
