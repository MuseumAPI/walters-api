    "Description": "The figure on this kashira is the legendary Chinese elder K\u00f4sekik\u00f4 (Ch. Huangshi Gong [Hwang Shi Kung]). He holds a staff in his right and a scroll of military strategy in his left. A famous story about him involved his encounter with the 3rd-century BC government minister Ch\u00f4ry\u00f4 (Ch. Zhang Liang [Chang Liang]). While riding a mule across a bridge, K\u00f4sekik\u00f4 dropped his sandal. Ch\u00f4ry\u00f4 returned it to him. As a reward, K\u00f4sekik\u00f4 gave Ch\u00f4ry\u00f4 a book of military strategy. Later, Ch\u00f4ry\u00f4 helped to establish the Han [Han] Dynasty (207 BC-AD 220). This is paired with a depiction of Ch\u00f4ry\u00f4 holding the shoe on Walters 51.980.",
