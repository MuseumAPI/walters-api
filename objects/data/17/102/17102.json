The background depicts a landscape and the rim is dark blue. On the platter are a group of peasants resting outside a city wall, one on horseback. In the center, a gypsy is telling a young man's fortune, and looking down from a portico at the left are two ladies. Both platters are marked in the lower right: C & C (or C & G). The backs are white.",
