    "Description": "A mace is a club-like weapon with a shaft and a large head, often with radiating flanges. In the Middle Ages, it was used by a knight on horseback in the combat that followed the initial charge with lances. With technical improvements in armor and other weapons, it lost its role in war but continued to be carried as a symbol of military rank.",
