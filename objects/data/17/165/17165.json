    "Description": "When this miniature was purchased it was described as a portrait of Countess Walewska, a Polish nobel woman and mistress of Napoleon I, but that identification is doubtful. A similar portrait, of a slightly larger size, can be found in the Wallace Collection, London.  Frame has basse-taile violets in the corners around the oval miniature, and probably dates from the 19th century.  Reverse appears to be tortoise shell or horn.",
