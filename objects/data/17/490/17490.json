It was written in Nasta'liq script by 'Abd Allah Mushkin Qalam (Amber-Scented Pen) in Allahabad in 1011 AH/AD 1602, according to the colophon on fol. 187a. A celebrated royal calligrapher, Abd Allah Mushkin Qalam worked in Allahabad for Prince Salim, who later became the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. The manuscript opens with a double-page illuminated incipit (fols. 2b-3a) and is illustrated with 14 paintings, including a portrait of the calligrapher himself (fol. 187a).
