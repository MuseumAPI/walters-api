    "Description": "Burroughs was a painter and museum curator. He studied at the Art Students League in New York City and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris with J.P. Laurens. He was curator of paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a painter he favored classical subjects given a modern twist, such as this painting of Helen of Troy making herself up at a very modern looking dressing-table while Troy burns in the background. Given that this painting is dated 1914, the year war broke out in Europe, the painting could also be read satirically.\r\n\r\nThe Walters Art Museum owns several works by the artist including a series of 20 oil sketches. Some were acquired by Henry Walters while other were gifted to the museum by of Burroughs' second wife, Louise, a writer and curator.",
