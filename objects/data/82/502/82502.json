    "Description": "The overall shape of the bowl, with its flaring walls and openwork handles, is in stil moderne (Russian Art Nouveau). On both faces, brownish yellow sea monsters, toying with pink balls in their jaws, swim amidst pink and blue jetsam in a turquoise field. These creatures are flanked by irregularly shaped reserves containing nautical scenes, each including a sailboat with a peacock prow; a swan; a blue fish, and a landscape. The bowl's rim is encircled by a band of tulip blossoms, threads of wire terminating in raised dots, and wire scrolls all against a blue and green ground. A row of gilt wire scrolls set against a blue ground borders the bowl's bottom edge. From the plain, silver gilt handles with pierced circular decoration, dangle pendants.",
