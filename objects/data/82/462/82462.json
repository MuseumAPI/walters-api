    "Description": "This tankard's most distinctive feature is the unusually complex lid with three arches supporting a central finial. Equally elaborate is its Baroque scrolled handle. The decoration in opaque and painted filigree enamel is raised over a finely granulated gilt surface. Each of the three sections of the body, defined by vertical bands, contains a medallion showing multicolored peacocks and a tree of life, large leaves, and blossoms. Interspersed in the surrounding interlace, are four exotic creatures: birds with combs, dove-like birds, rabbits, and quadrupeds, most likely tigers. The predominant colors include three shades of blue, turquoise, green, violet, and white with foiled red and foiled orange highlights. In addition, significant portions of interlace are black. \r\nInscribed on the base of the tankard: Andenken / Neapel / 1880 (Memory of Naples, 1880)",
