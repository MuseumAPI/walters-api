    "Description": "The upper portion of the bowl is decorated with a row of six-petaled, orange blossoms with extending pairs of branches in blue, violet, and green plique-\u00e0-jour enamel on a light blue ground. These motifs are separated by six alternating red and green cabochon stones. \r\n\r\nBelow, six large repous\u00e9e lobes alternate with six narrower lobes. The former are decorated with two variations of highly abstract, symmetrical floral designs in painted filigree enamel in deep green, violet and grayish grounds. The narrower lobes, which are more uniform in appearance, enclose symmetrical floral designs over a cerulean blue ground. The slightly flaring foot is bordered by a row of orange and greenish blue lozenge shapes over blue. \r\nThis bowl bears striking similarities in its floral motifs, symmetrical designs, and use of cabochon stones to another bowl by Alexseev (44.836).",
