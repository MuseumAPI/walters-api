    "Description": "Among Kuzmichev's most popular products were sherbet cups and stands, which usually adhered in form to the present examples. The cup's bowl is supported by three branches rising from a knob on the central stem. In this instance, the knob is enameled with the arms of the following locals: Moscow (Saint George and the Dragon); St.  Petersburg (crossed anchors and scepter); and Siberia (pair of black sables). Apart from the rim in a saw tooth pattern in blue, turquoise, and pink plique-\u00e0-jour enamel, the bowl's exterior is decorated with formal patterns in turquoise, blue, white and red champlev\u00e9 enamel. The interior of the bowl is lined with a creamy white, en plein enamel over a guilloch\u00e9 ground.\r\n \r\nThe plate (44.847) could have served as a stand for this sherbet cup. In its center is a formal interlace pattern incorporating white and red blossoms and vines. Continuing outwards is a band of flowers and tendrils in red, green, and blue champlev\u00e9 enamel. Next, there is a border of white, en plein enamel over a guilloch\u00e9 ground engraved in a basket-weave pattern. The monogram RHR in Cyrillic is enclosed within the white enamel. The outermost border is in plique-\u00e0-jour enamel in a saw-tooth pattern in blue, white and pink. The foot is also decorated in champlev\u00e9 enamel.\r\n",
