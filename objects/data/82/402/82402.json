    "Description": "Painted in matte enamel on the front faces of both the creamer and the sugar bowl are large vignettes showing in profile and in three quarters length a boyarina presenting on a tray a salt chair posited on a loaf of bread.  Her rushnyk, or towel, is embroidered in red.  Standing on a porch which is mostly concealed by snow-covered shrubbery, she wears a heavy green, fur-lined coat. Although the sun is waning, a white kremlin is visible in the background. \r\n\r\nThese silver utensils are rendered in stil moderne, or Russian Art Nouveau, as is apparent in both handles' shapes and their repouss\u00e9 surfaces which have been worked to show large pine trees and curlicues suggesting clouds.",
