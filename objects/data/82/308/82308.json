    "Description": "Portrayed is an event that had occurred during Russia's \"Time of Troubles\" in the early 17th century. The merchant Kuzma Minin stands in the town square exhorting the citizens of Nizhnii Novgorod to donate their valuables in order to finance a volunteer army. Even the children in the foreground are surrendering their toys. Led by Prince Dmitrii Pozharskii (1577-1642), the army expelled the Poles from Moscow in August, 1612. The victory resulted in Michael Romanov being elected tsar the following year, thereby founding the Romanov dynasty. This box was probably intended to commemorate the Tercentenary of the dynasty in 1913.\r\n\r\nThe outward flaring sides of the box are decorated in painted enamel with patterns of cloud berries and curvilinear motifs as well as with tightly wound filigree and distinctive hatch marks.",
