    "Description": "This coffee pot is equipped with a hinged lid and a silver gilt insert. Around its body there are four arabesque fields, each occupied by a symmetrical arrangement of multi-colored Usolsk-type blossoms over a pinkish white ground. These fields are set against a green background, which is also decorated with floral and leaf motifs. The foot, likewise, has vegetative designs over blue and green backgrounds. On the vessel's neck, large Usolsk-type blossoms alternate with blue, yellowish white and palmette shapes outlined in black. These have been enriched with raised gilt dots. As frequently occurs on R\u00fcckert's wares, a disparate note is struck by the coloring of the lid. The lower section has vegetative patterns over a blue ground whereas the domed portion is decorated with spirals over a pink and red surface. \r\n\r\nThe finial is in the form of a bud. Mother-of-pearl insulator rings have been inserted beneath the finial and at both ends of the handle.",
