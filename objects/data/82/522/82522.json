    "Description": "This remarkable vase, because of its size and complexity, is regarded as an outstanding example of Norwegian Art Nouveau enamel work. The bowl, which is executed in red and green plique-\u00e0-jour enamel shows the leaves and flowers of the peony, supported by two stems with leaves and blossoms of the same flower rising from an enameled base. Gaudernack trained in Vienna, but moved to Oslo in 1891. Initially, he worked for the glass house, Christiania Glasmagasin. He joined the silver firm of David Andersen in 1892 and by 1895 he had become the firm's major designer, a position he held until 1910. He began working in various historical revival styles, but soon adopted the Norwegian dragon style echoing Viking motifs. By the late 1890s, Gaudernack had fallen under the influence of the Art Nouveau style and between 1900 and 1908 he established his reputation with large, plique-\u00e0-jour, Art Nouveau pieces such as this vase.  As was his practice, this piece has been created in parts and then assembled.\r\n\r\nA drawing for the vase, now said to belong to the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C., is dated 1904, suggesting a date of 1904/05.\r\n",
