    "Description": "Czar Michael, the founder of the Romanov dynasty, appears in the central medallion holding the orb and scepter. Beyond, the sun is rising above Kostroma, an historic town 180 miles north east of Moscow. Two vignettes are set in the border, subtly enameled in violet and pale and dark green, one showing the Ipat'eff Monastery in Kostroma and the other, the Kremlin in Moscow. It was in Kostroma that the representatives of Russia's National Assembly informed Michael that he had been elected tsar in 1613. Flanking the dish are two Russian double-headed eagles with crowns. This plate was presented to an unidentified recipient by the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (1864-1918), the wife of Grand Duke Sergei, the son of Alexander II, after she had been widowed by an assassin's bomb in 1905 and had entered the Marfo-Mariinsky Monastery, which she had founded in Moscow.",
