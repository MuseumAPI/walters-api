    "Description": "This kovsh can be distinguished by its high foot and curved flat handle. Set in front, above the prow, is a vertical foliate member. The body of the kovsh is decorated with four rather restrained, symmetrical patterns of Usolsk-type blossoms and foliage in pink, violet, brownish orange, and pale blue and green filigree enamel. These emanate from a blue quatrefoils superimposed on a creamy white background. Separating the floral motifs are more of the smaller blue quatrefoils with three pendant bell flowers. Vine patterns extend overall. Recessed dots are amply used in the vine filigree and what appear to be grape bunch patterns.  Around the kovsh's rim extends a band of Usolsk-type motifs on an olive green background. Rows of abstract floral motifs and diamond shapes circumscribe the top and bottom of the foot.\r\n\r\nThe handle is supported by an interlace member in blue, green, and orange filigree enamel. Its upper surface is decorated with a cloudberry-like seed pod and a large blue flower with four plain recessed petals. \r\n\r\nFour orange and eight green cabochon stones have been mounted on the exterior.\r\n",
