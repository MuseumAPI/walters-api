    "Description": "The kovsh is enameled in delicate, complex patterns, many of which are repeated in units of twelve. Within a circle in the center of the bowl there is a twelve-petaled blossom in blue, white, and pink, which is enclosed by a band of twelve heart shapes, alternatively in green and blue, over a creamy orange ground. Proceeding outward, these are followed by twelve arched fields with stylized floral motifs and strap work over alternatively blue and white grounds. Around the periphery, there is a row of white lozenges and one with blue lozenges over a turquoise background.\r\n\r\nThe color scheme on both the handle and the prow differ in that the stylized blossoms and vines are in deep green, pale blue, white, and translucent red over a purple ground. Black enamel is also used sparingly throughout. Centered on both faces of the handle is a horse-shaped creature trampling a red and green dragon in a blue circle. Although the patterns differ, both the interior and exterior of the kovsh adhere to similar color schemes. Around the exterior of the kovsh's bowl there is a Slavonic inscription with turquoise lettering over a deep blue ground.\r\n",
