    "Description": "A mounted warrior holdng a bow and quiver of arrows appears in an oval reserve in the center of the kovsh. His shield bears the Russian double-headed, crowned eagle. Behind, a cloudy sky is partially illuminated by the setting sun. Bordering this central scene are four lozenge-shapes containing wire filigree \"feathers\" over a blue ground. Both the kovsh's walls and flat, horizontal handle are decorated with large, chrysanthemum blossoms connected by ribbon-like scrolls in translucent blue and green enamel over a pale green ground. The kovsh's top edge, as well as its foot, is bordered by foliate patterns in blue and orange translucent enamel together with yellow and orange motifs and blossoms.  Dispersed across the ground of the kovsh, overall, are loose spirals in brown filigree, tightly wound, silver-gilt filigree spirals, as well as orange enamel circles, some of which have crossed, hatch marks. A circular, open-work frame enclosing a griffin is mounted on the kovsh's prow.",
