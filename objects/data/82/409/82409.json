    "Description": "This teapot forms a set with Walters 44.851 (sugar bowl) and 44.852 (creamer). On each of the three vessels there are four cartouches enclosing a phoenix and a young bird, and some multi-colored blossoms, all painted over a creamy white ground. The cartouches are bordered with strands of twisted wire. The remaining background surfaces are decorated with tulip blossoms over a light blue ground. A band of stylized floral and geometric motifs on a deep red surface extends around the rims of each piece. Both the teapot and the sugar bowl have pine-cone shaped knobs and a band of solid blue turquoise extending around their lids. On the teapot is a mother-of-pearl insulator ring.",
