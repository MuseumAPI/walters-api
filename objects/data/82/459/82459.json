    "Description": "Two reserves are painted in glossy filigree enamel on this large, vibrantly colored kovsh. One shows a wedding feast in which the bride, identified by her kokoshnik, is seated at a table with the groom and four other diners while a servant serves a swan. In the other, the future husband and his parents meet the bride and her family. The execution of both scenes in this early work appears somewhat gauche given the overall quality of the floral enameling. On the vessel's exterior and the baroque-styled handle, there are multi-colored, Usolsk-type blossoms in painted filigree enamel against a deep red background. Beneath the kovsh's \"prow' appears a crowned, double-headed eagle, and, flanking the base of the handle, two warriors are mounted on winged steeds. A rosette is encircled by double-headed eagles alternating with stylized floral motifs on a plain gilt ground is positioned in the center of the interior.",
