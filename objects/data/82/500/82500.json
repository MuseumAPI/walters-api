    "Description": "The bowl's walls are divided into twelve swirling lobes. They are in opaque filigree enamel floral designs set against plique-\u00e0-jour enamel alternating with those with plique-\u00e0-jour floral patterns incorporated into opaque filigree backgrounds. The former appear in blue, white, turquoise and foil-backed red whereas the latter are composed of red, blue, yellow, and green motifs over a cream ground.  \r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the foot is divided into an upper section banded with rows of turquoise beads and violet half-moon shapes. On the lower portion are a row of turquoise beads and designs of alternating triangular shapes in white and green. \r\n\r\nEngraved in the center of the bowl is the monogram MLQ in Latin letters suggesting that this bowl, as was true of most of Kuzmichev's works, was exported and sold through Tiffany & Co. in New York.\r\n",
