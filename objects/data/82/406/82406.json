    "Description": "A chinoiserie flavor is imparted to this service by its exotic forms and vibrant colors. Each vessel is eight-sided and is bordered at the rim by upturned finials with knobs suggesting pagoda roofs. The sides are alternately enameled with turquoise and red grounds. On the turquoise sides, the motifs include a central, abstract flower with foiled red highlights flanked by feather-like filigree extensions and blossoms, and Chinese motifs. The red sides, in contrast, show branches of red, white, and blue flowers, green leaves and pseudo-Persian script in turquoise.",
