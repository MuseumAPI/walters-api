    "Description": "The six cups are shaped with five lobes, each set with silver appliqu\u00e9s in patterns similar to the flowers hanging from ribbons found on the teapot (44.724). The tray, which may not have originally been matched with the teapot and the cups, is divided into eight pie-shaped sections. Each of these contains floral and vegetative motifs in silver appliqu\u00e9s. In the center of the tray, a circle, decidedly of western European influence, encloses a unicorn, a rampant lion, and a fleur-de-lys. The tray is supported by four flat vertical feet.",
