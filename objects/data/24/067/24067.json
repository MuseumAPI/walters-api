    "Description": "Although this wax tablet has scenes divided by colonnettes, its style bears no relationship to that of the so-called group of ivories with colonnettes. The architectral canopy of two trefoil arches over each scene relates it to, among others, the Atelier of the Boxes of the later 14th century. The scenes in the lower register are the Annunciation and Visitation; in the upper: Gethsemane, and Arrest of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe iconography of the Annunciation is very similar to that of the Atelier of the Boxes. The Annunciation and Visitation are close to the same scenes on a panel from the Kofler Collection, including the arrangement of the headgear of Saint Anne. The Kofler plaque's unusually rich enframement and stylistic features suggest a north French or Flemish attribution.\r\n\r\nA large hole is drilled at the top for attachment to the other cover and intervening tablets. There is a depression for wax on the back.",
