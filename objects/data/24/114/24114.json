    "Description": "Pedon's nocturnal landscape with the eerie ruins of a castle is lit by the moon and a small fire that is reflected in the water. Some figures can be discerned, such as the two soldiers in the foreground, but the scene remains intentionally mysterious.\r\n \r\nPaintings of pastoral landscapes with an idealized countryside and ancient ruins, such as those by Van Bloemen exhibited nearby, were extremely popular during the 17th century; however, a few artists, like Pedon, were fascinated with the strange and unfamiliar aspects of nature.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 373, p. 491.",
