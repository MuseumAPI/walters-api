    "Description": "The popularity of ivory luxury goods reached its height around 1350, but they were made well into the 15th century. Associated with intimacy, mirrors were often given as courting gifts. A portable mirror consisted of a case in two parts with a polished metal disk fitted inside.\r\n\r\nIn this allegorical battle scene, knights attack ladies in a castle using catapults and crossbows that launch flowers. The ladies also shower their adversaries with flowers dropped from buckets. The god of love presides over all. A single knight has reached his lady by scaling the wall. This scene and those of the knights riding away may be three moments in an elopement narrative. The case originally had fantastic animals forming the four corners.\r\n",
