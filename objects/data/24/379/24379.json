    "Description": "This vase takes the form of a chrysanthemum (juban) or lotus (heban) peach bloom vase. They are named for the petals impressed around the base rising from the foot. An ovoid body with high shoulders curves upwards to form an elegant long neck with a flared mouth. This flower vase is covered uniformly with a rich peach bloom glaze, a pink blush dappled with apple red. \r\n\r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table. While the French term peau de p\u00eache (\"peach skin\") has influenced the English interpretation of the glaze as emulating a ripened peach, Chinese interpretation of the spotted red-green surface favors the apple with descriptions such as pingguo hong (\"apple red\") and pingguo jing (\"apple green\"). \r\n\r\nThe spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
