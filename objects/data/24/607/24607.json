This drawing bears an inscription on the reverse: \"Mr. Walters with the compliments of the author.\" It was formerly housed in one of William T. Walters' many drawings albums.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Grotto on the north side of the island of Capri had become renowned as an attraction for tourists during the 19th century.
