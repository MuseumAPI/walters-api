    "Description": "The Virgin lies on her funereal bier, with the disciples gathered around her. John, to whom Christ specially entrusted his mother (John 19:27-28), leans close by her head, with Christ standing behind him holding her soul, represented as a child in swaddling clothes. Two angels wait to receive the soul from Christ's arms. The two houses in the background represent Jerusalem, by tradition the location of the Dormition and also a reminder of the symbolism of Mary as the representation of the Church, the new Temple of Jerusalem. The door painted on the Virgin's bier is an unusual detail of unclear significance.\r\n\r\nThe icon's style resembles that of the last generation of icon painters of the Moscow Armory, just before the center of state-supported art moved to the new capital of St. Petersburg.",
