    "Description": "This container for kohl (eye shadow) or ointment is made in the shape of a kneeling Syrian who supports on his shoulders a large amphora, which as been scooped out to hold ointment. The bearded, long-haired figure wears chest bands and a kilt with cross-hatched decoration. The piece appears to be unfinished. The hastily incised chest bands, the unusual belt, the lack of a cover or a dowel hole for a lid and the opening at the mouth of the amphora are peculiar. The authenticity of this piece is not certain.",
