The connections go further than this, however; it can be proposed that this head was cast in Chiang Mai by a Sukhothai-trained craftsman.\r\n\r\nThere are several Lan Na detached heads, similar in style, that were originally joined to the body at the neck, with corresponding notches on each edge.",
