    "Description": "This unidentified woman has a cool, confident expression. Her hair is powdered white, and her low-cut dress is decorated with flowers, but she wears no jewels, coquettishly suggesting the innocence of a simple shepherdess fashionably combined with urban sophistication. Though the execution is close to that of Longhi's signed known portraits and introduces the silvery tones which lend a quality of aristocratic detachment to his ladies, there are too few signed portraits of women by him to be certain of the attribution.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 453, pp. 564-565.",
