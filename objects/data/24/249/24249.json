    "Description": "During the early 19th century, the popularity of earrings briefly declined when women's hairstyles covered the ears. Fashion changed in the 1830s, once again exposing the ears, which prompted a revival of this type of jewelry. The posts and three pendants of these earrings (together with Walters 44.524) each depict masked youths and ladies- probably an allusion to the popular costume balls of this period. The French term \"girandole\" is used in the context of jewelry to describe earrings composed of a post with three pendant stones or ornaments.",
