    "Description": "Four holes located beneath the rim of this vessel suggest its use as a hanging planter. Painted on the globular body in underglaze blue and overglaze enamels of red, yellow, and two shades of green is a natural scene of blossoming branches, perched birds, tall grass, and distinct rock formations. Around the shoulders are two rings in underglaze blue and beneath the raised rim of the mouth is a band of curved points. \r\n\r\nCorruption and exploitation of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen caused an influx of porcelain artists to begin private practice at private kilns during the Transitional period (1620-1683) between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Manchu occupation of China also shut down most of the imperial kilns. Private kilns produced functional and economic shapes, painted with naturalist subjects (human figures, animals, landscapes). \r\n",
