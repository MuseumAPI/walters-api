    "Description": "This plaque was probably made for private devotion. The Virgin is seated beneath the tau-shaped cross, the ends of which are cut aslant. Above is the titulus inscribed INRI, She wears a dark purple robe, a white wimple and a long blue mantle which is drawn over her head. Across her lap lies the body of Christ, still wearing the crown of thorns, and draped with a lioncloth. The head of Christ is reverently supported in a green kerchief by a holy woman at the left, dressed in a mulberry-colored robe. At the right, stands Mary Magdalene who wipes her eyes with a cloth and carries a blue pot of ointment. She is dressed in a robe of the same color as that of the other holy women, nearly hidden by a mantle of gold-brown. The three haloes also are painted in the mulberry color. Beyond is a green landscape, with sketchy indications of grass and trees drawn in dark lines under the green enamel. The deep blue sky is dotted with stars.",
