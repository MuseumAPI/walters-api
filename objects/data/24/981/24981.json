    "Description": "Ziem, the most peripatetic of 19th-century artists, is remembered for his prolific Venetian views produced during a long career spanning almost seven decades. He was born in Beaune, Burgundy, his unusual Polish surname being that adopted by his paternal grandfather, an Armenian. Ziem's family settled in Dijon in 1831 and six years later the future artist entered the town's Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he distinguished himself in architectural and landscape drawing. In 1842, Ziem embarked on his first extensive tour, traveling to Italy, where he visited Venice before continuing to Austria and Germany. His travels continued at an unabated pace for the remainder of his career. Stopping points included Moscow, Kiev, St. Petersburg, Holland, Turkey, Egypt, and Algeria. He preceded the Impressionists with his work in situ, contriving a floating studio in Venice and employing a caravan in the Fontainebleau Forest. \r\n\r\nThis painting, characteristic of many of Ziem's Venetian views looks toward the Grand Canal from the Canale di San Marco. In the foreground are two boats, one small rowboat and a larger sailboat, while the city is visible in the background. The scene is suffused with a warm, golden sunlight.",
