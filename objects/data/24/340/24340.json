    "Description": "The fragment consists of a hand and an arm complete nearly to the shoulder. Thumb and fingers are very narrow at the base of the nail. Nails are crudely indicated. The thumb and first two fingers are extended, the other two fingers curled, the elbow bent, and the muscles of the arm strained in violent action. It appears that the arm was not in a vertical position but was raised somewhat. Unless the hand held something which as left no trace, the action may be dancing. The break at the top crosses a rectangular cutting for an inlaid repair. The arm is hollow. The surface is black with patches of red and green, and has been roughly scraped in cleaning.",
