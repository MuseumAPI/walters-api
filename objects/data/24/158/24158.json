    "Description": "Originally paired with an image of the Crucifixion, this plaque was once attached to the binding of a Gospel book or a missal.  When the book was read aloud during the liturgy, its enameled covers would have reminded the faithful of Christ's earthly suffering and heavenly glory.  The son of God sits upon a rainbow, surrounded by four creatures that symbolize the Evangelists.  The Greek letters alpha and omega that flank Jesus' head refer to his words: \"See, I am coming soon; my reward is with me, to repay according to everyone's work.  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" (Revelation 22:12-13).",
