    "Description": "This triptych in a copper frame, designed to be worn hanging at the chest, is an example of a composition known as 'Deesis,' in which the Virgin, John the Baptist, and other saints bow in intercessionary prayer toward Christ the Almighty. In the central panel Christ sits on a wide throne and holds an open book with the first words of Matt. 11:28, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, [and I will give you rest]\". To his right stand the Virgin and the archangel Michael, to his left, the archangel Gabriel and John the Baptist, at his feet kneel Zosimus and Sabbatius (founders of the Solovki Monastery in northern Russia), and behind him are the Apostles John, Peter, Paul, and Andrew.\r\n\r\nIn the upper row of the left panel stand Simon, James Son of Zebedee, and three evangelists. Below them are Judas Brother of the Lord, Bartholomew, Philip, Thomas, and James Son of Alphaeus.\r\n\r\nThey are joined in the upper row of the right panel by Simeon, Joachim, Anne (the mother of the Virgin), Parascheve, and Catherine. Below are Nicholas, Demetrius, George, Anne (the martyr), Julitta and Cyricus.\r\n\r\nThe triptych opens on hinges, fastens with a hook and hasp, and has two suspension shackles at the top.",
