    "Description": "The central scene depicts the deceased as a warrior in a \"naiskos\" (small temple) with a young servant by his side. Male and female figures on either side of the temple carry various items like wreaths, vases, and dishes with branches or food as offerings for the deceased. The opposite side shows a similar scene with four offering bearers, but the temple is replaced by a grave stele. Like the large volute \"krater\" by the Baltimore Painter (48.86), this vase is typical of the ornate style of Apulian vase painting- with multi-figured funerary scenes and intricate decoration. This \"krater\" has been attributed to a well-known painter named after a vase in Copenhagen (inv. no. 4223).",
