[Despite the abundance of heraldic evidence, the original ownership of W.104 cannot be readily ascertained. In a note on file from the unidentified French dealer from whom Henry Walters acquired the manuscript, it is proposed that the first owners were Louis I of Ch\u00e2tillon (d. 1346, son of Guy of Ch\u00e2tillon, count of Blois) and Marguerite of Valois, sister of King Philip VI of France. This supposition rests on the threefold depiction of the Ch\u00e2tillon de Blois arms, twice in a joust against an opponent bearing the arms of the house of Namur, and once against a representative of the house of Hainaut or possibly Flanders (fols. 19r, 81v).]",
