    "Description": "Inspired by the Chinese glass he had seen during a trip to Berlin, Emile Gall\u00e9 began to work with opaque colored glass in 1884. Within four years, he developed a technique of working with cased (layered) glass in which Art Nouveau or Japanese-inspired designs were etched through the outer layers with acid to create inexpensively a carved cameo effect. Most of Gall\u00e9's pieces were mass-produced at the glasshouse of Burgum and Schverer in the town of Meisenthal in eastern France. Production of his works continued there after his death until World War I.\r\n",
