    "Description": "St. Jerome (ca. 341-420), one of the Fathers of the Church, did penance in the Syrian desert for having focused on classical studies instead of on Christ.  He then returned to civilization to combine these passions in his great translation of the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin.  This image was deeply inspirational to Christians devoted to the study of the classics.\r\n\r\nThis plaque was to be hung in a private space.  Perhaps in the 1600s, the original frame was replaced with the present one, decorated with enameling to imitate turquoise and lapis lazuli.  The effect suggests the influence of Turkish metalwork.\r\n",
