    "Description": "This example of a blue and white wine jar is painted in underglaze cobalt blue in three registers. The body is divided into medallions of paired male and female phoenixes and framed by peony splashes. Below and above the phoenix designs are dragons chasing flaming pearls among clouds. Together the dragon and phoenix represent the Emperor and Empress and often appear on imperial porcelains. The jar is globular in shape with a slightly tapered body and short rimmed mouth painted with scrolling clouds. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha's Head blue, replaced or was mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
