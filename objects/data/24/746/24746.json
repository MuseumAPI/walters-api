    "Description": "The monk Kurodo Tokugo wanted to get back at the people who ridiculed him because of his big nose, but his scheme failed.  He posted a notice saying a dragon would rise out of Sarusawa pond on a certain day.  When he went to the pond he meant to ridicule everyone who would believe something so absurd.  But instead he got caught up in the excitement of those who were awaiting the dragon and, forgetting his own made-up story, he joined in the chanting of Buddhist prayers.  Although--according to the story--no dragon ever appeared, in this print a grinning dragon spirit materializes behind the monk as he frantically makes magic gestures.",
