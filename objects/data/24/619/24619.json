    "Description": "By the late 1600s, groupings of five or seven Chinese porcelain vessels with alternating shapes were often displayed over doors in European homes. A complete set was called a \"garniture.\" This jar, painted with underglaze cobalt blue decoration, is a garniture piece made for export. The meiping shaped jar, with broad round shoulders and narrowed everted foot, is decorated on four sides with composite mystical creatures that combine the head, scales, and flames of a dragon with the body shape, pushy tail, and paws of a lion. Each lion-dragon stands on a rock jutting from crested waves; scrolled clouds swirl overhead in the sky. Buddhist emblems and Taoist Treasures are painted on the neck alternating with cloud scrolls; included are The Conch, The Artemesia Leaf, The Musical Stone, and The Umbrella. The lid, which flares out over the shoulder and is topped with a radish-shaped handle, is painted with a landscape of mountains, trees, a humble hut, and a river where a man fishes. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt painting, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
