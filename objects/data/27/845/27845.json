    "Description": "Two knights are jousting in front of a grandstand, in which a king, queen, and two courtiers appear behind a draped railing. Two heralds are on horseback at the left; three spectators stand at the right. The knights wear chain mail with plate leg armor and great helms. Both helmets have crests, and the knights are defended with ailettes on their shoulders and shields. The knights' horses are caparisoned. The scene is a variant of the one shown on the Parisian box, Walters 71.264.\r\n\r\nTwo sections of the border are missing and have been replaced with wood. There are twelve holes for the metal mounts. Where three lateral mounts crossed the lid, the ivory has been recarved to continue the design, which would originally have been unfinished.",
