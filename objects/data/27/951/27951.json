    "Description": "Imperial medallions, such as this one of Constantius II (reigned 350-361), were often mounted by their recipients to boast of their highly favored status in society. This stunning example, minted in Nicomedia (Asia Minor), represents on the reverse the triumphant emperor in his chariot. Smaller coins were also mounted as jewelry, like the smaller aureus honoring Galeria Faustina (died 140/141), wife of Antoninus Pius. Other mounted coins, separated by lengths of chain, would have completed this section of either a belt or a necklace.",
