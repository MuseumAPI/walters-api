    "Description": "The story of Phaeton, or Pheathon, is described in \"The Metamorphoses\" by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-AD 17). Son of the sun-god Helios, Phaeton once decided to drive his father's chariot across the sky. When he lost control of the horses, endangering the earth, Jupiter killed him with a thunderbolt. Here, Phaeton's mourning sisters are being transformed into trees. Ovid wrote that their tears became amber, carried away by the Eridanus River (today known as the Po River), symbolized by the reclining river god. The swan is Cycnus, Phaeton's friend who was transformed through his grief into a bird.\r\n\r\nBernardi, one of the most important engravers of rock crystal of the Renaissance, made this piece in Rome for Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici (1511-35). It copies a famous design by Michelangelo.",
