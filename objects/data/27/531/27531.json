    "Description": "This is the pouring element that would have been attached to a horn-shaped vessel for perfume or medicine. The head with curved nose, fleshy chin, and a plain wig is carefully carved. The head has Syrian physiognomy. The band around the back of the wig is unusual. This may be a mistake on the part of a non-Egyptian carver or it may represent the tie of a wig cover.",
