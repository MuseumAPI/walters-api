    "Description": "Saint Jerome (ca. 347-420) was one of the four Latin Fathers of the Church (the others being Saint Augustine, Ambrose, and Gregory the Great) and renowned for his translation of the Bible into Latin. The image of the saint in his study was popular during the 15th century, especially with scholars.\r\n\r\nThe writing implements, scrolls, and manuscripts testify to Jerome's scholarly pursuits. The sandglass and dying candle allude to the passage of time and remind the viewer that life is short. According to legend, the saint removed a thorn from the paw of a wild lion, which became Jerome's companion, here shown as a household pet. Jerome was considered to be a cardinal of the Church, and a cardinal's red hat hangs prominently on the back wall.\r\n\r\nDa Fabriano's delight in realistic detail shows that the artist was one of the first in Italy to be influenced by Netherlandish painting.  Inscribed on the piece of paper seemingly tacked to the saint's desk: 1451; Inscribed on the original frame, lower center: ANTONIO De FABR[IAN]O; Inscribed on the saint's halo: SCVS. JERONIMUS\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 125, pp. 190-191.",
