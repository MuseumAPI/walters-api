    "Description": "This relatively small mirror case is divided into four compartments by four highly stylized trees growing from the center. The scenes show pairs of lovers of different ages and social conditions embracing, admonishing, and caressing each other. The four monster corner terminals are restorations, and the back has been scored as if for some other use.\r\n\r\nThe subject of pairs of lovers divided by four trees appears in other French mirror cases.",
