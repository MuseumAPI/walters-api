    "Description": "This box is chiseled, partially enameled, and set with three oval portrait miniatures representing:\r\n\r\n1. Napoleon I (1767-1821) wearing the uniform of \"chausseurs \u00e0 cheval.\" Visible on his chest is the star of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n2. The \"King of Rome\" (1811-1832), Napoleon's son by his second wife the Empress Marie-Louise. He wears the band and star of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n3. Empress Marie-Louise (1791-1847), the daughter of Francis I of Austria, who married Napoleon in 1810. \r\n\r\nThe bees surrounding the miniatures were imperial symbols alluding to the Napoleon's royal predecessors, the Merovingian Frankish kings who ruled France from the 5th-8th centuries. Jewels discovered in their tombs were mistakenly identified as representing bees rather than cicadas.",
