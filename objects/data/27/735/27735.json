It has not only the robe edge that runs from mantle to waist and the presence of pleats between the legs but also the broad face and particularly squat body characteristic of the local tradition.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture is a marriage: although both head and body are old, they were joined together at an unknown date, perhaps relatively recently.  It is possible that both parts were made in Nakhon Si Thammarat at about the same time.",
