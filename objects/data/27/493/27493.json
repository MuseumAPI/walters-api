    "Description": "\"We found the way exceeding rough in journeying to these Lakes, and as if that was not enough were digged a great part of the distance by about 20 Crow Indians, who had some cause of grievance with one of our party.  As we rode, the Trappers levelled at them fierce expletives in French, interspersed with sac-r-r-r-es, with a fearful roll on the r-r-'s, Enfans des garc\u00e9s, &c., they of course not understanding a word.  At lenght we rid ourselves of them by riding at night and crossing some mountain Torrents, thereby losing the trail for them.  \r\n\r\n'No primrose road of dalliance' met our eyes, we scrabled over rocks, through briars and brushwood, crossed rapid streams and ascended steep acclivities.  We at least found ourselves on the borders of these beautiful Lakes, and were richly repaid for all our difficulties... The sketch, although conveying some idea, must of necessity fall short of the enchanting reality.\"  A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
