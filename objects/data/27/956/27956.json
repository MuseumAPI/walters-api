    "Description": "This Armenian Gospel book was produced in 904 of the Armenian era (1455 CE) at the monastery of Gamaiel in Xizan by the scribe Yohannes Vardapet, son of Vardan and Dilsat, and was illuminated by the priest Xac`atur. The priest P`ilipos commissioned the manuscript as a memorial to himself, his parents azar and Xut`lumelik`, and other relatives listed in the colophon on fols. 300r to 301v. P`ilipos is depicted on fol. 14v alongside his brothers Yusep` and Sultansa, as they kneel before the Virgin and Child enthroned (Theotokos). The book contains twenty-six full-page polychrome miniatures, including four Evangelist portraits; ornately designed canon tables; four decorated incipit pages; numerous marginal miniatures of floral and faunal motifs; and nineteen marginal miniatures of biblical characters or allusions to biblical narratives.",
