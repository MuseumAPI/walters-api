    "Description": "This life sized steatite fish, glazed a deep blue green color, which represents the tilapia nilotica or \"bolti\" fish. It appears that details such as the fins, gills and eyes were carved into the stone prior to glazing. A hole has been bored in the mouth region, emerging underneath the gills on the underside of the fish; this hole may have accommodated a rope or wire of some kind. The glaze has been rubbed off in the mouth region. This fish may have served as a vessel or ritual object.",
