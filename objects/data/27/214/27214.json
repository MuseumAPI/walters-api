    "Description": "Hand-held crosses, called hand or benediction crosses, are carried by Ethiopian priests and offered to the faithful to be kissed during church services.  Made out of metal or wood, the crosses are also used by priests to bless holy water and to perform exorcisms. Beginning in the 16th century, hand crosses also appear as signs of victory in icons and manuscripts, where they are held by saints, archangels, and even the resurrected Christ. \r\n\r\nThis object has a conventional design, but the cross in the center appears in silhouette. As a result, during benedictions this opening could be used to project a cruciform shadow onto the object or person receiving the blessing. The rectangular base may be interpreted as a reference to the tabot, or carved altar box, venerated by Ethiopian Christians.",
