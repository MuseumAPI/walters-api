    "Description": "From 1884 until his death, Pissarro lived in relative isolation in Eragny-sur-Epte, a village in northwestern France. Though he participated in all eight Impressionist shows, his approach to painting continued to evolve throughout his career. This picture, with its staccato brushwork, shows Pissarro's interest in Pointillism, a technique of painting explored by the younger painter Georges Seurat. Pointillism relies on the eye's ability to blend small areas of contrasting colors to produce the illusion of a full spectrum.",
