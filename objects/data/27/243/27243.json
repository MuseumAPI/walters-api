    "Description": "Naro Dakini was considered the female partner of the great Buddhist mystic (mahasiddha) Naropa (956-1040). She is depicted within a magical diagram (yantra) in her Himalayan paradise. During a ritual, the form of the goddess would be mentally projected into the diagram. She lifts her skull cup high, in order to pour blood into her mouth. Following one interpretation, the blood is her own menstrual blood, which then enters the central channel that expert meditators imagine inside the body. In fact, the goddess is sometimes called Nadi (\"channel\") Dakini. She is a picture of a yogic exercise.",
