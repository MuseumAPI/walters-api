    "Description": "Barrias, who was noted for his female allegorical figures, produced a nude version of this subject in white marble for the Faculty of Medicine at Bordeaux in 1893. Six years later, responding to the renewed interest in multicolored sculpture inspired by ancient Greek accounts, he exhibited at the Paris Salon such a statue of Nature that was partially draped. It was made of red and gold onyx, malachite, and lapis lazuli. This highly decorative, smaller replica of the 1899 statue was issued by the foundry Susse Fr\u00e8res the same year. A final version in white marble, made in 1902, was acquired by the \u00c9cole de Medicine in Paris.",
