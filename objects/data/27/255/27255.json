By 1840, it had become the most influential literary publication of the time in the United States, especially through the contributions from such writers as Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel Parker Willis, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and by Clark's own departments, the \"Editors Table\" and \"Gossip with Readers and Correspondents.\" During his career, Clark made an enemy of fellow editor and author Edgar Allan Poe. The two traded insults in their respective magazines.\r\n\r\nCharles Loring Elliott was the leading American portraitist of the mid-19th century. Mainly working in New York City he portrayed many artists and writers.",
