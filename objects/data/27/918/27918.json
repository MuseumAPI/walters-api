    "Description": "In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Elam, to the east of Mesopotamia in Iran, experienced a brief period of prosperity during which it allied itself with Babylonia against Assyria. The seals produced in Elam during this period reflect themes derived from Mesopotamia, such as the lion hunt seen here; however, the strong modeling, the almost decorative patterning of the details, and the exaggerated posture of the lion characterize the local Elamite style.",
