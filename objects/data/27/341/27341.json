    "Description": "This lovely young woman's fanciful headdress marks her as Venus and not Eve. She was once part of a group of statuettes that recreated the classical myth of the Judgment of Paris. In a contest conceived by the goddess of Discord, the Trojan prince Paris was asked to judge who among Venus (goddess of love), Juno (wife of Jupiter, king of the Olympian gods), and Minerva (celebrated for her wisdom) was the most beautiful; a golden apple was presented to the winner. Venus here holds the apple that memorialized her triumph. Although the subject is from classical antiquity, the rounded proportions of the figure are thoroughly \"modern\" German.",
