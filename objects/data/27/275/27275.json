    "Description": "Trouillebert studied with mid-19th century figure painters A. A. E. H\u00e9bert and C. F. Jalabert, producing genre scenes and portraits before turning to landscapes. His later works were strongly influenced by the tonal paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, the master who worked at Ville d'Avray. Trouillebert painted on the banks of the Oise, Vienne, and Loire rivers in France, continuing the traditions of the Barbizon landscape painters. This landscape, strongly resembling the works of Corot, depicts a tranquil scene along a river. Several large, dark trees dominate the foreground, and a figure rests in their shade on the grassy bank. A smaller tree on the right contrasts with the soft blue of the sky and the wispy white clouds.",
