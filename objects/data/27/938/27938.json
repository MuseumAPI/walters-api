    "Description": "This bronze toy mounted knight is one of the earliest extant toy soldiers. The figure would have held a jousting lance, possibly made of wood, in his right hand. Many such toys were undoubtedly made\u2013they were easy to produce, not requiring precision in their modeling to make them effective?but few survive today. Most were lost or broken through long use. The workmanship is crude, but for any little boy with his head full of dreams of becoming a knight, it was enough.\r\n\r\n",
