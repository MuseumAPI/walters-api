    "Description": "This late manuscript in many ways resembles a printed book, with page numbers, chapter headings, and an extensive table of contents. The book was intended for young women and contains a wide variety of prayers, teachings, and reflections. It is illustrated throughout with inserted engravings by a number of artists, evidently cut from other books; most bear the names of the artists, and many have numberings from their original editions. An ownership inscription at the back of the manuscript bears the date 1772, and one of the engravings (on fol. 84r) contains the date 1754, suggesting that the manuscript was created in the third quarter of the eighteenth century.",
