    "Description": "A servant stands to the right of a copper urn drawing water into a bucket. At the left a towel is suspended on the wall and on the floor are placed a large ceramic jug and a small bowl. Weisberg (1979) suggested that the artist, in this instance, drew inspiration from Chardin's \"La Pourvoyeuse\" or from \"La Fontaine de cuivre.\"\r\n\r\nThis subject is recurrent in Bonvin's work. In later versions such as the \"Servant Drawing Water\" (Louvre R.F. 462), painted in 1861 for the actor P. Bressant, and \"The House Maid,\" J. S. Inglis Sale, American Art Association, March 11-12, 1909, no. 101, dated 1867, the artist included vistas of a kitchen in the right background, recalling the compositions of Dutch 17th-century masters, notably those of Pieter de Hooch.",
