    "Description": "Even as a baby, Hercules demonstrated his superhuman strength, when he strangled two serpents sent by the goddess Juno to kill him.\r\n\r\nPrints based on compositions by Italian painters were used by French artists as sources for mythological imagery and as stylistic models reflecting the ancient Greco-Roman sculpture with which Italian artists were more familiar. Here, Limosin used an engraving after a drawing by Giulio Romano. The gray monochrome, or \"grisaille,\" favored by Limosin imitates the appearance of ancient sculpture.",
