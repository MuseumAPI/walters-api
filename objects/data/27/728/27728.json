    "Description": "The panel shows Christ in Majesty, seated on the throne, holding the Gospels, and making the gesture of teaching with his right hand. On the background of his mandorla is inscribed: EGO S(UM) (I)S Q(U)I S(U)M (I am that I am, Exodus 3:14). At the corners are the symbols of the four Evangelists: top, the Man of Matthew and the Eagle of John; bottom, the Lion of Mark and the Ox of Luke.\r\n\r\nMany examples of the type in ivory, metalwork, and enamel descend from models like the ivory book cover of Abbot Notger, datable to about 982. The ivory is closely paralleled by the silver book cover of the Evangelary of Anastasia in Warsaw of Mosan origin and datable to the 3rd quarter of the 12th century, made in the region of Liege.\r\n\r\nThe panel was intended for a book cover, but was reused, as the three holes indicate. It is considerably rubbed from use, and shows evidence of brown stain.",
