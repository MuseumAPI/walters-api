    "Description": "This scene from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts a moment during the wandering of the Israelites in the desert after their escape from the bondage of Egypt. The Israelites came into the wilderness of Zin, and evil place, and they thought that they would die there, because there was no water. Moses (depicted here with horns as a sign of his encounter with divinity), struck a rock with his staff, and water flowed from it.",
