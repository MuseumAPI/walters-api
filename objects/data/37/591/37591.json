    "Description": "These companion images represent the abbot Nicolas \u00e0 Spira (on the right) in prayer to his patron saint, the 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas.  On the backs of the panels are remnants of an Annunciation scene, with Gabriel on one panel and the Virgin on the other.  The panels were part of an altarpiece, with the Annunciation visible as a unified scene on the exterior of the wings when the altarpiece was closed.  On the interior, the two Nicholases flanked a lost central image, perhaps a Madonna and Child.  The altarpiece, signed and dated by the little-known Jacques de Poindre, was commissioned by the abbot for his Abbey of Grimbergen in the southern Netherlands.\r\n\r\nDepicting the saintly bishop and the living abbot in similar ecclesiastical vestments lends dignity to the latter.\r\n",
