Silver and bronze coins were issued for local, everyday use, and generally followed the design of Roman coins with a bust portrait of the ruler in profile on one side.  Aksumite coins were the first in the ancient world to carry the cross as a symbol of the ruler's devotion to the Christian religion.",
