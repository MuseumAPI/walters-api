    "Description": "According to Church (but not biblical) tradition, Mary Magdalene (probably indicating that she came from the the town Magdala) was a sinful woman, who upon meeting Christ repented her former ways. She was present at the Crucifixion and later went to anoint Christ's dead body (in accordance with Jewish burial ritual), only to discover that he was resurrected. As in this painting, the Magdalene is often depicted as a great beauty with long golden hair. She is shown here transferring the ointment from a maiolica pharmacy jar to a smaller vessel.  \r\n\r\nThe painting has been attributed alternately to Andrea Solario and Bernardino Luini, both artists iluenced by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, both in their definition of form and in the subtle \"sfumato\" technique that invisibly blends light and shade and make contours appear soft.\r\n\r\nFor more on this panel, see most recently Giovanni Morale, \"Smarrita e prediletta\" Maria Maddalena nel Rinascimento lombardo ( Milan: Skiara, 2014).",
