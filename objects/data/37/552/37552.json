    "Description": "An Alsatian artist who trained in Italy in the 1860s, Henner's work fell outside the mainstream of French painting. Although he could be a vigorous realist, as seen in his religious paintings and portraits, Henner's posthumous reputation rests on his numerous images of nude women with long auburn hair. This painting is a variant on \"La Source\" or \"Spring\" exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1881. One of the models was Dorothy Tennant.\r\n",
