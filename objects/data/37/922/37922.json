    "Description": "This image stands somewhat apart from the images that appear to have been made in Ayutthaya itself in about the 1st quarter of the 15th century.  It has a radiance in the form of a spike or elongated gem, rather than a flame; it is deep; and the pedestal is less contracted and does not have a vertically edged element at the bottom.  It must, therefore, be the product of a different region, possibly Suphanburi or Sanburi.\r\n\r\nIn the new Sukhothai and related styles, there is an ideal facial shape.  The U Thong-style sculptor tends to proceed somewhat differently, working outward from the facial features, focusing on the expressive mouth and eyebrows, with only a general notion of proper facial shape.",
