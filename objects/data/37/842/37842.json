    "Description": "The center of this thin dress ornament, which would have been sewn onto a garment through the four holes, is dominated by an imperial cross. The two globes on either side of it represent the two empires (East and West), ruled by two-emperors during the 2nd half of the 5th century. Testing of the extensive enamel decoration revealed this to be a skilled forgery and not a Byzantine piece, as it was long believed to be.",
