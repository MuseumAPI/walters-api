    "Description": "Originally a wing of a triptych, this piece would have been mirrored by 71.161.  The wings were made to overlap when closed.  This panel depicts three saints: a biship saint at the top, identifiable by the crosses on his maphorion, and two unidentified deacon saints below.  The back of the panel is carved with a cross. The style of this wing and its pair is related to the Triptych Group and there are holes on each wing for attachment to the central panel.",
