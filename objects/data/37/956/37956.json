    "Description": "This vessel dates to the 16th century, when artisans in Ottoman Turkey, working primarily in the city of Iznik, attained new levels of technical and aesthetic achievement in the long Islamic tradition of ceramic production. Characteristic features of Iznik wares include a hard, white body, crystal-clear glaze, a wide range of brilliant colors, and an elegant painting style.\r\n\r\nOttoman ceramic artists took much of their inspiration from nature and created designs incorporating both recognizable plants, flowers, and trees and stylized leaves. Familiar species depicted on this plate includes lanceolate leaves and peonies.",
