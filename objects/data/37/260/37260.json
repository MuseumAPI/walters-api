    "Description": "A couple stands within a hexafoil against a crosshatched ground; a stylized castle is at the right and a tree at the left. The man wears a \"houppelande\" with wide sleeves; the woman's \"houppelande\" is pleated and belted. The woman wears a veil on her head and presents her partner with a large rose. The spandrels of the hexafoil are filled with masks, and the mirror is brought to a square with four corner leaves showing incised veins. There are two later holes drilled in the cover. \r\n\r\nThe iconography relates this piece to Walters 71.269.",
