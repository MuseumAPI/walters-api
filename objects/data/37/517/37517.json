    "Description": "A winged woman (possibly Nike, the goddess of victory) rendered frontally in repouss\u00e9 adorns the cover of this large hinged mirror. She moves swiftly to the right as she glances back over her shoulder. In her left hand, she holds a swan or goose close to her body. Her extended right hand holds a wreath. The loose, flowing garment clings to the figure, revealing her body beneath. Such a mirror would have been a suitable offering to a heroine. In vase-painting Helen is frequently shown holding a mirror, an attribute that emphasizes her celebrated beauty; it also appears in vase-painting as an attribute of brides.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the goddess Nike, who personified military victory as well as triumph in athletic or musical competitions, probably indicate her ability to bring swift victory. She was also associated with love and the world of women.",
