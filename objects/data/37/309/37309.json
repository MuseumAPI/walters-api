    "Description": "The study of classical texts continued to influence the production of manuscripts during the reign of Charlemagne's heirs and successors. In a mid-tenth-century gospel book probably produced at Corvey in Germany, the beginning of the Gospel of Luke is laid out with large, beautiful capitals modeled on the square capitals in Roman epigraphy. The angular letters are a clear departure from the rounder capitals common during that period and are a conscious imitation of Roman grandeur.\r\nAs in Roman epigraphy, the words on this page are written continuously without breaks or punctuation.",
