    "Description": "The four outer figures on each side are kings of the primary and intermediate directions of the compass. The white shaft at the center is a four-faced linga, or \"sign,\" of the god Shiva. Paying homage to the linga are the creator-god Brahma and his spouse on the left, and Vishnu and his spouse on the right. Shiva created a shaft, a cosmic pillar, so tall that Brahma could not reach its top and Vishnu could not find its bottom. Shiva, demonstrating his supremacy, then appeared in the pillar.",
