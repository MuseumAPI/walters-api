    "Description": "Saint Theodore was a Christian soldier who was persecuted by the Roman authorities on account of his faith. Small cut-stone images of him, like this one, were encased in precious metal frames and worn around the neck by both clerics and laymen. Theodore is shown in full battle gear, including a round shield hung over his shoulder. The dedicatory inscription by the donor of a similar portrait of the saint together with his namesake Theodore the Recruit explains: \"Christ points to you, O Theodores, as my armed protectors, so that you deliver me from all danger. . . .\"",
