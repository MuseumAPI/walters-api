    "Description": "Rosa Bonheur was among the most celebrated painters of animals in the 19th century. She frequently depicted plowing scenes that highlighted her command of anatomy, which she studied through dissection and at horse fairs and cattle markets.\r\n\r\nBonheur attracted many patrons from abroad, especially from Great Britain and America. In 1860, she purchased the ch\u00e2teau of By in the village of Thomery, not far from Barbizon, where she lived with a menagerie of exotic animals.",
