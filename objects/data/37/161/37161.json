    "Description": "The artist's poem in the upper right corner of this work tells of the intoxicating blossoms of peach and peony filling his courtyard garden. His painting then presents these two lovely flowers in a manner that we never see in nature. This seemingly simple relishing of the beauty of flowers is a reference to the glories of spring, marked here by its start with the peach blossoms and its end with the peonies.",
