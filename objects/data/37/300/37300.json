    "Description": "This image can be called representative of the classic Early Ayutthaya style because it conforms to the ideals of large-scale stone sculptures and because it resembles gold images deposited in the crypt of Wat R\u00e2tchaburana in Ayutthaya.  \r\n\r\nThere are elements that can be considered formulaic: the arc of the sockets repeats that of the forehead band; the curves of the outlines of eyes, nostrils, and lips appear to echo each other.  This sense of having arrived at a \"solution\" is what helps give this, and the many images like it, a classic aspect.  What is worth remarking, however, is that despite the popularity of the type at the period of its creation, in later centuries it does not appear to have been much emulated.",
