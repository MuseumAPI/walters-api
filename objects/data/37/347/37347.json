    "Description": "This drawing, Walters manuscript leaf W.747 is tinted with red and dates to the mid 10th century AH/AD 16th and was executed in Safavid Iran. It depicts a man on horseback wearing early Safavid headgear. There are 4 inscriptions at the bottom of the page, 3 of which are legible. Two name well-known Persian artists. The inscription on the far right attributes the work to Bihzad, in reference to Kamal al-Din Bihzad (died 942 AH/AD 1536-1537), the most celebrated Persian painter. The one inscribed in red mentions the Safavid artist Siyavush (died ca. 1025 AH/AD 1616), a Georgian slave who became boon companion to Shah Tahmasp (reigned 930-984 AH/AD 1524-1576). The seal at the top of the page is dated 1126 AH/AD 1714. The image is framed by an inner pink border with illuminated floral design and an outer blue border with floral and fauna motifs.",
