    "Description": "Before achieving enlightenment \u2013 a state of freedom from desire and the suffering it causes \u2013 the meditating Buddha was assaulted by the forces of Mara, a demon who personifies both death and the attachments that trap living beings in a cycle of worldly suffering. Prevailing over Mara, the Buddha touched the earth with his right hand so that she would witness his moment of victory\u2013and his enlightenment. Gazing downward in an expression of meditative tranquility, this Buddha at once embodies a calm equilibrium and a radiant energy, present in the flame-like rays that emerge from his head and in the shining gold that once covered his entire body.",
