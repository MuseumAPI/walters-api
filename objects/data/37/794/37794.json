    "Description": "Backhuysen's seascapes demonstrate the simple, harmonious proportions found in many Dutch depictions of the ocean: water occupies about one quarter of the compositions, while ships silhouetted against an immense cloudy sky occupy the remainder. This recreates the experience of being out on the water; indeed, Backhuysen hired fishermen to take him out in storms to study wind and waves.\r\n\r\nThis painting is from the 1660s, the artist's best period. His fame was such that in 1697-98, when the Russian tsar Peter the Great visited the Dutch Republic to study European shipbuilding and the arts, Backhuysen was asked to teach him painting.\r\n",
