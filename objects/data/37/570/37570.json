    "Description": "Twenty-four finches, varying in pose and color, are perched in a row. This watercolor is a variant of one of the artist's most popular subjects, \"Un b\u00e2ton de cage.\" Another variation of this composition in the Lucas Collection of The Baltimore Museum of Art is inscribed: \"Giacomelli a Mr. Lucas affecteux souvenir d'une aquarelle.\" Henri Beraldi wrote of this artist, \"Giacomelli is the Van Huysum [Jan Van Huysum, 1682-1749, Dutch flower-painter] of tiny birds, tender and ravishing, which give the impression of being pensive. The bird is to Giacomelli what the cat is to Lambert [Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Lambert, 1825-1900, French painter who specialized in cat subjects]. A respectable bird must be a Giacomelli bird; A non-Giacomelli bird is a false bird,\" (H. Beraldi, \"Les Graveurs du XIXE si\u00e8cle,\" Paris, 1885-92, 7:105).",
