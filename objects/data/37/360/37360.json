For the rulers of the Hindu courts during the 18th and early 19th centuries, series of \"Ramayana\" illustrations provided models for behavior and sources of enjoyment. In a scene from his childhood, Prince Rama adjusts his bow. To the left is his brother Lakshmana and, further to the left, the sage Vishvamitra, Rama's teacher. Vishvamitra encourages Rama to take action against a demoness.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
