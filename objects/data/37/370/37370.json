    "Description": "This unusual crozier branches into two volutes, containing on one side St. Valerie kneeling with her decapitated head, guided by a small angel. St. Martial, the bishop who converted her to Christianity, is seen on the other side, celebrating the Mass. At the top is the archangel St. Michael; all three were patron saints of Limoges. Made for a choirmaster, this crozier's two volutes symbolize the two parts of the chants (verses and responses) that were traditionally sung by a choir of monks.",
