Some of his \"Orientalist\" paintings are of documentary interest whereas others are highly romanticized.\r\n\r\nThis small panel, commissioned by William T. Walters, depicts two hounds being walked by a Nubian in a barren and windy desert. The trim shapes of the dogs suggest that they are \"Pharaoh Hounds,\" a breed descended from the hunting dogs of ancient Egypt.",
