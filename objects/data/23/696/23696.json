    "Description": "This tapestry roundel was likely one of a set that decorated a larger household textile, such as a curtain or wall hanging.\r\n\r\nCurtains and wall hangings were used in private homes, as well as in public and religious buildings, to prevent drafts, divide spaces, and provide privacy. The tapestry weave of this piece is ideal for such textiles, as it produces a design that can be viewed from either side.\r\n\r\nThough the majority of the population was Christian by this time, figures from classical mythology continued to decorate objects of daily use. Especially popular were portrayals of pairs of famous lovers. Here, the attribute of the lyre identifies the male figure as either Orpheus or Apollo, indicating that the female must be either Eurydice (Orpheus's wife) or the nymph Daphne (loved by Apollo), or perhaps one of the nine Muses, frequently associated with Apollo.",
