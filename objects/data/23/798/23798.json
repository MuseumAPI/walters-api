    "Description": "This flask is decorated with images of Christ, the Virgin, and two military saints (Sergios and Bacchos?), represented with the soft, voluminous drapery and staring eyes typical of the art of Byzantine Syria. The inscription tells how the donors, Megale and her family, gave this flask in fulfillment of a vow and for the eternal salvation of departed souls. The flask, the original lid and chain of which are now lost, was probably used to hold consecrated oil for the rite of baptism, or for the anointing of the sick or dying.",
