    "Description": "According to legend, the Roman emperor Augustus asked a prophetess if there was anyone greater than himself.  It was the day of Christ's birth, and the answer came to the emperor in a vision: a golden circle around the sun, in the middle of which was a beautiful virgin and a child.  One side of the pendant shows Augustus and the other, the Virgin and Child. \r\n\r\nThe sophisticated style, superb workmanship, and imagery connect this piece to the Parisian workshop of Jean and Paul de Limbourg from Guelders (in the northern Netherlands), who created some of the finest International Gothic manuscript paintings.  They initially trained as goldsmiths and their younger brother Arnold (of whom no works are known) was a goldsmith in Guelders.  The enamelist who created this masterpiece and a few related works was an accomplished painter as well as a goldsmith.",
