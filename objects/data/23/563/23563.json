    "Description": "A direct link between the Barbizon generation and the impressionists, Boudin encouraged Monet to paint landscapes directly from nature. This harbor scene was painted in 1874, the same year as the first impressionist exhibition, which included works by Boudin. In this scene, the evocation of the grays and pinks of a cloudy day aptly demonstrates why Corot called Boudin the \"Monarch of the Skies.\"\r\n",
