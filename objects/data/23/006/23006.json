    "Description": "The French miniature painter Jacques Charlier is mainly known for his mythological and erotic scenes. He worked in the style of Boucher and was popular with collectors in the 19th century at the same time that Boucher's work was sought after. Charlier's work refers to Boucher so often and explicitly that it is thought that some working arrangement existed between the two. This miniature of Venus and Cupid is also very similar to Boucher's work.\r\n\r\nThis miniature has a metal back, in the same style as the frame of 38.20, and both frames are probably later than the miniatures.",
