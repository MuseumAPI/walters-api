    "Description": "The enthroned Virgin holds the Child on her left knee and a flower in her right hand. Her left foot is placed on a hillock. The standing Child holds an apple and gazes upward. The folds of the drapery are deep and crisp.\r\n\r\nThe oil polychromy is old but not original. The shapes of the faces and painting of the eyes and hair give a doll-like appearance. \r\n\r\nThere is an old ivory plug through the lower part of the Virgin's drapery. Her head is carved to receive a metal crown. The back is slightly curved and shows the bark of the exterior of the tusk.",
