    "Description": "The tall cross is set off against a sky overcast with somber clouds. From them and from a black aperture at the top shoot bolts and shafts of light. At the horizon is a blue ridge of hills below which are clustered the buildings of Jerusalem, trees and a stream. Beside the cross the Virgin bows her head and clasps her hands. St. John lifts his two hands in mourning and adoration. A skull and a bone lie at the foot of the cross. In the grass, at the lower left, is the signature L L, the two letters are separated by a fleur-de-lys.",
