    "Description": "Jean-Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber (1753-1800), French general, received his military education in Munich. Resigning his commission in the Austrian army, he returned to France and studied fortification and military science. Winning distinction in the Vend\u00e9an war, Kl\u00e9ber was made division general. Under Bonaparte, he sucessfully commanded his division in Syria, taking El-Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Mount Tabor in 1799. Kl\u00e9ber, with only ten thousand men, defeated the Turkish army of sixty thousand at Heliopolis and went on to take Cairo, where he was assassinated in 1800.",
