    "Description": "The unidentified sitter presents himself as a sculptor by the stylus for sculpting clay in his right hand, and as an architect by the compass and architectural drawing on the table. Behind him is a statue of Roma, the female personification of the city of Rome, while through the window a segment of the Triumphal Arch built for Emperor Constantine is visible.\r\n\r\nThe portrait expresses the reverence for the sculpture and architecture of ancient Rome that characterized the age of Neoclassicism. The lifted, serene gaze and illuminated face, framed by the white wig, suggest that the architect's art is inspired, guided by the examples of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 423, p. 533.",
