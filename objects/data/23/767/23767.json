    "Description": "This example of a tangluo xi or gong-shaped brush washer is covered with a peach bloom glaze on the outside and a white glaze inside. Its glaze is a muted red peach bloom with subtle mottling. The shallow brush bath has a compressed rounded body and wide inturned mouth. \r\n\r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table. The gong-shaped brush washer is one of the more common of the set. While the French term peau de p\u00eache (\"peach skin\") has influenced the English interpretation of the glaze as emulating a ripened peach, Chinese interpretation of the spotted red-green surface favors the apple with descriptions such as pingguo hong (\"apple red\") and pingguo jing (\"apple green\"). \r\n\r\nThe spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
