    "Description": "This is a large yokomono depicting people of different classes celebrating the arrival of spring blossoms. In the distance, people arrive by ferry boat, then follow a winding path which ends under a cherry tree in full blossom. Here, a vendor in a peasant hat sells puppet dolls to a group of excited children newly-arrived with their parents, who gaze in awe at the blossoms. Seated on a carpet nearby, an older scholar is about to brush a poem while observing the same blossoming tree.  Two serving women prepare tea for him and two friends. Screened from public view by a curtain, a more elaborate party is also taking place. Beautifully dressed servant women have served sake to their noble mistress, who is being entertained by a dancer and a group of musicians seated under another blossoming cherry tree. In the further distance, families of common people have prepared their own refreshments and pursue their own amusements. Children play games while parents relax and observe the blossoms, one man using a telescope to see more distant views.\r\n\r\nThe painting is in excellent condition; it was completely remounted in 1990, with fitted wood box and futomaki.",
