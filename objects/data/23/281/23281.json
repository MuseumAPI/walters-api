    "Description": "Miller was impressed with Shim-a-co-che (High Lance), the Crow chief, a distinguished man, \"full of dignity, and such as you might look for in a well-bred civilized gentleman.\"  Miller noted his \"grave look,\" the \"well-cut Roman nose,\" and the \"forehead [that] retreats overmuch...,\" and recalled that Shim-a-co-che had protested that some of the other sitters for Miller's portraits were common Indians who had counted no coups and did not deserve to be painted.  - Extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
