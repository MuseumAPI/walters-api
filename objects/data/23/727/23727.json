    "Description": "This party of fashionably dressed young people is interrupted by intruders with masks and a lighted torch suggesting that these revels take place during Carnival. Well-bred young ladies did not join parties in public inns; these smiling women are prostitutes. Women forced by poverty into prostitution had to rent such garments, as they themselves were rented. The lap dog gnawing a bone adds a crude but amusing counterpoint to the apparent elegance of the scene.",
