    "Description": "This baluster shaped vase of white porcelain is painted in underglaze cobalt blue. A flowering plum tree emerging from the jagged rockery covers the body. The plum blossom is emblematic of the return of life in the spring following winter. Two swallows symbolic of fidelity and love are depicted as well. Outline and wash technique is utilized to provide a variety of shades of blue and textures to distinguish rough rock from soft petal. The vase of elegant shape curves inward beneath high shoulders and has an everted foot. A wide neck is interrupted by a raised ring through the center and has a slightly flared mouth.  \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt painting, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
