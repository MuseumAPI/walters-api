    "Description": "The simply dressed Virgin Mary and the naked Christ Child remind the viewer of the Christian virtue of humility. The landscape behind them suggests an idealized site from Perugino's native Umbria in central Italy, given a paradise-like beauty and serenity. The colors are vivid and yet harmonious.\r\n\r\nPietro Perugino (which means the one from Perugia) was famous for his pious and sweet style, and, by the late 15th century, he was one of the most popular artists in Italy. His fame led to the commission of a wall fresco in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 112, pp. 173-174.",
