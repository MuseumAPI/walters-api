    "Description": "Prosper Dorbec in \"L'Hell\u00e9nisme d'Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin,\" in the \"Gazette des Beaux-Arts,\" 5th per. 9 (1924): 30-31, singled out Fromentin as a classicist among Orientalists. For the painter-writer, according to Dorbec, the desert and the ramparts of A\u00efn Mahdy became the plains of Ilium. In this spacious view, characteristic of the artist's production in the mid-sixties, the bold silhouettes of the horsemen, their generalized treatment and the essentially static composition reaffirm the classical character of Fromentin's painting. \r\n\r\nShown are a group of Arabs examining a horse being displayed for sale. A rather similar composition, \"Horse Market in Algeria,\" 1867, appeared on the New York art market in 1913. Related studies include a view similar to the group of would-be purchasers in this scene, \"Five Standing Arabs,\" 1874, The William Hayes Ackland Memorial Art Center, 76.36.1; a smaller subject sold in the Verd\u00e9-Delisle Collection, Paris, H\u00f4tel Drouot, May 29, 1879, no. 35; and a three-figured composition sold at the H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, March 12, 1943, no. 26.",
