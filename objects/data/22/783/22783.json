    "Description": "This pilgrim bottle flask of white porcelain is painted with underglaze blue and red designs. A five-clawed red dragon is depicted on either side, facing forward and body coiled to protect an effulgent flaming pearl at the center. Flames issue from the scaly serpentine body of the dragon. In blue are painted the foaming crested waves along the bottom and the scrolling clouds covering the sky. The flask is round in form, thus giving it the name full moon flask. Two waving handles are attached at the shoulders and the straight narrow neck. \r\n\r\nThe emperor of the Qianlong reign (1736-96) was a great patron of the arts, commissioning and supporting production of monumental, literary, and domestic works. Blue and white porcelain of this period draws from Xuande (1425-35) wares and exhibits a crisp and controlled elegance of decoration. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
