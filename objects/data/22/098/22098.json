    "Description": "The 7th and early 6th centuries BC are known as the Orientalizing period because of the many eastern, or \"Oriental,\" elements in the art. In this prosperous era of international trade, Etruscan artists manufactured luxury goods, such as those seen in this case, that reflect influences from the art of the eastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThis buckle consists of two pieces that would have been attached to either end of a leather or cloth belt. The three loops of one piece connect with three corresponding hooks in the form of snake or animal heads on the other. This type of buckle appears to be inspired by Near Eastern examples.",
