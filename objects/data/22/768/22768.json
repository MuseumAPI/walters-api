    "Description": "The body of Christ, his head illuminated by a halo of light, rests on the lap of the seated Virgin. St. John supports it under the right shoulder with his right hand. The left foot is held my Mary Magdalene, who is about to wipe her tears with a cloth. Behind are other holy women and the cave. At the left, Nicodemus holds the vase of myrrh and aloes. In the background the tau-shaped cross rises on Golgotha, a skull and bone at its foot. In the distance under a cloudy sky are the pinnacles of Jerusalem. \r\n\r\nThe Piet\u00e0 shows by its composition and also by its facial characteristics that a model by Jean P\u00e9nicaud I was used. Similar Piet\u00e0s from the P\u00e9nicaud workshop were made to be inserted into paxes. Paxes went in pairs, since they were presented to the congregation to be kissed, simultaneously on the Gospel side of the church and on the side of the Epistle.",
