    "Description": "In this scene, papal troops intercept brigands who are looting a coach and carrying off its passengers. During the 19th century, brigands, or \"banditi,\" posed a real threat to travelers in rural areas of the Italian states, but they were also idealized as daring outlaws.\r\n\r\nHorace Vernet, the director of the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome (1828-34) and professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1835-63), was regarded as a leader of the \"juste-milieu,\" or the middle course between the opposing Romantic and Neoclassical factions in French painting. He chose dramatic, often contemporary, subjects but rendered them with the smooth brushwork and attention to detail associated with the Academic tradition.",
