    "Description": "After moving from Paris to the village of Barbizon on the edge of the Fontainebleau forest in 1851, Millet devoted himself to portraying the lives of his neighbors. Some critics interpreted his paintings of working farmers as a critique of the injustices inherent in the social conditions of his time. Others have seen his work as a representation of man's harmonious union with nature.\r\n\r\nOn the right a farmer is pouring a basket of potatoes into a sack held open by a woman.  Beside the couple are three full sacks and a cart.  Further back, at the left, two en are digging potatoes which are being gathered by women.  The sky at the left is suffused with warm sunlight, whereas the right side is darkened by a glowering, low-lying rain cloud.",
