    "Description": "This kozuka shows two Taoist immortals standing under a pine tree. These two are often shown together because they both had the ability to send their spirits out of their bodies. Leaning on the branch of the tree is Tekkai (Ch. Teiguai [T'ieh Kwai]). He left his body for seven days to consult with Laozi [Lao-tzu] and when he returned could not reenter his old body. He had to take the body of an old beggar by the roadside who had recently died. Sitting under the tree is Gama (Ch. Hia Mo) with a three legged frog on his shoulder. Like Tekkai, Gama's spirit once returned to his body and was unable to enter it. He put his spirit into the nearest creature, which was a frog.",
