    "Description": "The plaque illustrates the first two scenes of the story of the Prodigal Son and should be read from bottom to top. In the first scene, the father divides his inheritance as the Prodigal, who is shown in an elegant hat, is observed by his mother and brother. Above, the Prodigal rides with his hawk, followed by a servant with a chest full of treasure. As they approach a young woman, the servant raises a warning finger.\r\n\r\nThe scenes are set beneath canopies of trefoil arches. There are two holes drilled in the center at the sides for cords to attach the leaf to others. The back is recessed to receive a coat of wax for writing.",
