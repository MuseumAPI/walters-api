    "Description": "The story threads its way from the upper left rear to the lower right front: Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane and then taken into custody; Christ before Pilate; the Flagellation; the Mocking of Christ; Christ Carrying the Cross on the road to Calvary; the Crucifixion; the Deposition (the dead Christ removed down from the cross); and the Entombment.\r\n  \r\nThe use of simultaneous narrative - showing events that happened in sequence all together within one continuous space - is an ingenious device for conveying the inevitable flow of one event into the next.  This format was developed around 1470 in Bruges for paintings meant for the home.  The use of stage-like settings and dramatic gesture owes much to contemporary religious theater.",
