    "Description": "This extravagant bracelet consists of five arched segments and three foliate segments. Judging from indentiations in the original leather case, this piece was originally a diadem with two additional foliate elements rather than a bracelet. All the pieces are hinged together and carried out in elaborate openwork decorated with precious stones and scrollwork. The five large segments imitate Gothic architecture with ogive arches and columns.",
