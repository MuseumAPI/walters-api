    "Description": "This three-part panel was originally part of a large altarpiece whose central image probably represented Saint Catherine with the wheel of her martyrdom. The left-hand panel depicts her vision of the Madonna and Child: the Christ Child did not find Catherine worthy because she wasn't baptised and refused to look at her. The middle scene illustrates her baptism.  The right-hand panel presents her second vision of the Madonna and Child: as a baptised Christian she is now worthy in Christ's eyes and she is joined to him in a mystic marriage. \r\n\r\nThe delicate figures reflect the continuing influence of the International Gothic style. Swabian painters of the following generation developed a more harsly realistic style. Other fragments from the same altarpiece are now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt.",
