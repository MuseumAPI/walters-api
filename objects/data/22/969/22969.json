    "Description": "A three-fourths length standing portrait, this painting depicts what appears to be a middle aged or older woman, wearing rings and other jewelry and her hair covered. She stands in front of a curtain and to her right, behind the curtain, a few shelves hold what may be several bottles and books.  \r\n\r\nThe contents of the shelves to the rear suggest that she is standing in a study, probably that of her husband, perhaps a physician. A companion portrait of him probably hung to her right, our left.\r\n",
