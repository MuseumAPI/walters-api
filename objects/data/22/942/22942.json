    "Description": "Melodic musical themes known as modes (\"raga\") were important subjects in sets of miniatures produced for the regional courts of India in the 17th-19th centuries.  The name of one \"raga\" is Bhairava- a god who is also the lord of music.  Bhairavi (spouse of Bhairava) gives her name to a \"raga\"-variation (\"ragini\").  In art, she personifies the \"ragini.\"  She appears here worshiping at a shrine holding a \"linga,\" the emblem of the great god Shiva.  The inscription at top says, \"The fair and pure Bhairavi worships Shiva with songs accompanied by cymbals in a crystal shrine beside a lake.\"  A sculpture of Shiva's bull, his means of transportation, sits outside the shrine.",
