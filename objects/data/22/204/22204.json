    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts a scene from the story of Noah's ark. Here, the ark is nowhere to be found. The fountains of the great deep have broken up, and the windows of heaven have been opened. Five great plumes of water tumble from a red heaven into a broiling ocean. It has already rained for many of the forty days, and the beasts, birds, and people of the earth ate laid to rest in ordered strata, like sediment, on the ocean floor. The people are the last to drown. The great flood will prevail upon the earth for a hundred and fifty days.",
