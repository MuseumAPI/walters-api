The subject provided him with an opportunity to depict facial expressions and to undertake figurative studies of sensual beauty. He painted another view of the same event--\"Slave Market in Rome\" (St. Petersburg, Hermitage Museum)--in which the viewer looks over the heads of the spectators towards the slave.",
