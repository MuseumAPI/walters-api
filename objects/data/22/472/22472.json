    "Description": "This thanka commemorates Sange Yarjon, third abbot of the Taklung monastery. Sange Yarjon belonged to the Kagyu sect, which was established in the 11th century. Key figures include the Buddha Vajradhara (top left), ultimate source of the teaching; Marpa (above the rocks, between Vajradhara and Sange Yarjon), a founder of the Kagyu sect; and Tashipel (top center), who established the Taklung monastery. The officiator at the ceremony of consecration (bottom left) may be Sange Yarjon's successor. In style, the painting continues the Indian tradition, with the figures placed in small caves surrounded by geometrical rocks.",
