    "Description": "Aoki Mokubei was best known as a potter, but his interests in the broader world of the arts led him to write poetry, to paint, and to contribute broadly to aesthetic theories around the turn of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nMokubei's active denial of conventions of composition that are tied to physical properties of the natural world is one of the distinguishing qualities of his paintings. While this work may on its surface appear challenging, it is profoundly important as the surviving work of his in the loose \"so\" style. It can appear to be a casual and loose set of marks to the casual observer, but given a few minutes of observation, the lines form a vision of a mountain landscape that is tinged by soft pastel colors.",
