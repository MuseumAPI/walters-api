    "Description": "This reconstructed wood and bone box was probably used by a wealthy woman to store her precious jewelry.  Two different techniques were used to carve the bone plaques on its sides and top.  For a number of the male nudes, the carver scraped away the background, leaving the figures in raised relief.  For other plaques, such as the female dancers, deep fine outlines were carved first, then filled in with colored wax.",
