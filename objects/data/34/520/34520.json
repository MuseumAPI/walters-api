    "Description": "Representations of cats were popular in ancient Egypt, particularly in Bubastis, the cult center of the love- and fertility-goddess Bastet, who is represented either as a cat or as a woman with a cat's head. During the Late and Greco-Roman periods (6th-1st century BC), people donated cat figures (associated with fertility, love, and protection) to temples throughout Egypt. This cat is adorned with golden earrings, a beaded collar, and a necklace with a \"wedjat\"-eye pendant, which symbolizes the protection of the sun god.",
