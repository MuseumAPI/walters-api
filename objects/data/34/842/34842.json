    "Description": "The square plate of this buckle is divided by cloisons (wire strips) into small cavities set with garnets and blue and green glass pastes. Cross-hatched gold foil underlies the remains of the central green paste. This would have given a shimmering effect to the setting when this buckle was new.  Such buckles are characteristic of Visigothic metalwork.",
