    "Description": "This lamp is shaped like a foot wearing a sandal and is topped by a rod with a serpent crowned by a sun disk. Lamps played an important role in the rituals connected to the solar aspects of Harpocrates and Serapis, as well as in the Isis mysteries. The Serapis-foot demonstrated the god's eternal presence. These feet were mostly combined with a bust of the deity, and this lamp likely had such an image of Serapis on the lid.",
