The couple pass an oxherd on their way to a mountain abode, where the woman will give birth to eight sons, each representing a traditional Chinese virtue (loyalty, wisdom, truthfulness, and so forth), the names of which appear around the neck of the vase. The story was taken from an early 19th-century Japanese novel, \"Hakkenden,\" \"The Story of Eight Dogs.\"",
