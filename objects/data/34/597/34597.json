    "Description": "On the left panel of this superb devotional ivory, St. George, in medieval armor, raises his lance and shield in triumph.  An angel lifts his helmet from his head, as the rescued princess leads away the defeated dragon.  The right panel shows the Virgin and Child between Saints John the Baptist and Catherine of Alexandria.  The choice of St. Catherine suggests that this diptych was made for the private use of an aristocratic woman.",
