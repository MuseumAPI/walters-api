    "Description": "The Roman governor, wearing a turban, is seated on a cushioned bench set on a podium. A kneeling page, wearing a fantastic headdress, pours water from a large ewer into a bowl placed on the lap of Pilate. A servant standing nearby grasps a long towel which is thrown across his shoulders. At the right, two guards lead Christ away.\r\n\r\nThe subject is copied after a print of Lambert Hopfer, which was inspired by the corresponding scene in the \"Little Passion\" of D\u00fcrer (B. VIII, no. 10 [180] p. 527).",
