    "Description": "Shown is an incident from the Gospel of John (8:3-11). The adulteress, forced into a kneeling position, flails her arms as her executioners prepare to act. To the left stands the serene, imposing figure of Christ. Spectators include Pharisees and scribes. This small painting, with its carefully delineated, idealized figures and its remarkably clear atmosphere, is reminiscent of the works of the Nazarenes, a group of German painters active in Rome in the early 19th century.",
