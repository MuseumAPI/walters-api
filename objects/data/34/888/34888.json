It served in the field both as a weapon and as a tool.  The blade is inscribed on each side \"I A N\" between quatrefoils of punch marks; in addition, a maker's mark is impressed on the back.\r\n\r\nThe blackened iron sheath contains as well a smaller knife (the blade bearing the mark of three small crosses) and a skewer for use in camp.",
