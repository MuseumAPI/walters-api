    "Description": "The first such ivory figurines of the Virgin and Child appeared around 1225 and were inspired by the monumental stone sculpture on the portals of Gothic cathedrals. This piece contains a number of symbolic details: The crown identifies the Virgin as the Queen of Heaven. The lily she holds stands for her purity. The orb in Christ's hand reminds the viewer that the infant child is also the creator and ruler of the universe. The elegant sway of the Virgin's body reflects the curve of the elephant tusk from which the figure was carved. Ivory became widely available in western Europe after the Fourth Crusade of 1204 opened the commercial routes leading from Constantinople through Egypt to the interior of Africa.",
