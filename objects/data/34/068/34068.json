    "Description": "This small prayer image of Christ's birth emphasizes the divine nature of the event. Jesus sits majestically upon his mother's lap, blessing with his right hand both us and the approaching Magi. The latter wear small Persian hats that identify them as inhabitants of the East. Two angels flank the manger of the Nativity, which was still being shown to Bethlehem pilgrims at the time this icon was made.",
