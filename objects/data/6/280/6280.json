    "Description": "The archangel Raphael was sent to guide the young Tobias on his travels to complete a transaction for his father, as recounted in the Catholic Old Testament Book of Tobit. One of the supernatural wonders that occurred before they returned home involved the fish that Tobias carries here. Following instructions from his companion (whose wings he cannot see), Tobias will later burn its liver in rescuing his betrothed from the devil. Once home, he will use the fish's gall to heal his father Tobit's blindness.\r\n\r\nThe figures give this romantic landscape the high moral purpose associated with biblical subjects. The painting may be a collaboration of two court painters: Denis van Alsloot, a landscapist, and Hendrick de Clerck, a figure painter.",
