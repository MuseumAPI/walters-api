    "Description": "The Walters Art Museum holds a number of works by George Henry Boughton, who was popular with both William T. and Henry Walters. Boughton had trained in France with Edouard Fr\u00e8re in the 1860s (another artist well represented at the museum). William T. Walters visited Boughton's studio in London with George Lucas as early as 1867 and William visited again in the 1883. Meanwhile in 1881 Henry Walters had viewed the work of Alma-Tadema in the Royal Academy alongside Boughton. The artist may have played role in introducing the work Alma-Tadema to William and Henry.",
