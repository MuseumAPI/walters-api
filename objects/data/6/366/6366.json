    "Description": "Vasari may have painted this biblical scene as well as three others (Walters 37.1177, 37.1705, 37.1704) in brown monochrome as a study for related compositions in a series of 18 larger, multicolor panels representing the correspondences between the Old and New Testaments made in 1545-1546 for the sacristy of the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara in Naples. Vasari's skill with the pen comes out in the preliminary drawings, visible in The Fall of Manna, to which he added layers of paint with his brush and fingers.\r\n\r\nThese particular subjects relate to the establishment of the Holy Eucharist (Communion), when the priest at the altar symbolically re-enacts the sacrifice of Christ. This episode from Genesis foreshadows Christ's sacrifice or the role of bread as sustenance and as an offering. Abraham returns from battle having freed his brother from the enemy and is met by the high priest Melchizedek, who offers him bread and wine.\r\n\r\nFor more information on these panels, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 216a-d, pp. 333-335.",
