    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts two scenes from the life of Joseph.  Top image: Joseph rose from disaster to rule Egypt under Pharaoh. His brothers came seeking grain. Joseph had their sacks filled, but had a cup placed in the sack of Benjamin, the youngest of the brothers. \r\n\r\nBottom image: The brothers brought Jacob to Joseph, who went to meet him in Goshen. And Joseph fell on his father's neck and wept. And the elderly Jacob said to Joseph, \"Now let me die, since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.\"",
