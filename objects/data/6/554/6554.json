    "Description": "A young gentleman wearing a sword and a lady with a pet squirrel meet in the woods, indicated by trees in the background. The scene is set within a frame of nine lobes, whose spandrels are filled with bearded masks. Two of the four crouching-monster corner terminals have been damaged by burial. There are losses on the back as well, and a new hole is drilled at the top.\r\n\r\nThe lobed frame is usually considered a sign of a date after the mid-century, but the figure style suggests that this may be an early use of the mask frame.",
