    "Description": "Van Diest's seascapes are full of vivid details, for example, the figures clinging to the wreckage as ships break up in a violent storm. Protestant sermons and popular literature urged the Dutch to see moral lessons in nature and everyday life. Whether a shopkeeper or ship owner, someone seeing such a painting in a home might well reflect upon the soul on its journey through a life fraught with dangers. The foundering ship flies an English flag-the Cross of St. George-perhaps a reference to Holland's great maritime rival.",
