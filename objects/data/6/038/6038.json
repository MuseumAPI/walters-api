    "Description": "Made of gold, this necklace has an oval blue stone flanked by two green stones, with all three in box settings hinged and secured with toggle pins.  Below is a cruciform assemblage of two garnets and two green stones, also in box settings and hinged in the same manner.  The rest of the necklace, compromising pairs of green stones, garnets, and pearls, is ancient but probably did not originally belong to the centerpiece of mounted stones.",
