    "Description": "This chess piece of a queen seated inside a castle is modeled on similar pieces made in the Arab world in the 8th and 9th centuries and brought to western Europe as gifts or articles of trade. The queen's headdress, a close-fitting hood with headband, is typical, though, of royal garments worn in 12th-century Spain. The piece is carved from a walrus tusk, used as a cheaper alternative to elephant ivory. This is the only medieval chesspiece of a queen in an American collection.",
