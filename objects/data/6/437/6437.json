    "Description": "George A. Lucas (1824-1909) of Baltimore sailed to Europe in 1857, never to return to America. During his long residence in Paris, he supplemented his private income by representing the interests of a number of American collectors, including William T. Walters of Baltimore and Samuel P. Avery of New York. In a preface to a publication of 1885, Walters wrote of Lucas, \"The debt I owe him for his good judgment, mature experience and cheerful co-operation in nearly all I have accomplished as amateur and collector, I find only less than the value I place upon his sterling truth, and upon his worth as a man and a friend.\"\r\n",
