The bottom is broken and a lower piece has been reattached.\r\n\r\nTwo oval plaques in the Benaki Museum, Athens, show an identical subject and positioning of holes, top and bottom, for pinning the pieces to a backing. Only one hole is preserved on the Walters piece. The function of these oval plaques is unknown.",
