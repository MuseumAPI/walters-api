    "Description": "A dragon emerges from swirling, crested ocean waves which form the pedestal for the jar. The flamboyance of this elaborate relief is in keeping with pieces from the late Edo period (early 19th century). This flower jar may have been part of an altar arrangement in a Buddhist temple.\r\n\t\r\nThe inscription translates: \"Made by Seimin, residing in the Eastern Capital.\"\r\n\t\r\nThis flower jar was made in three pieces: a cast bronze base with a lacquer patina; a cast bronze bowl, chemically patinated and with silver inlay for the dragon's claws; and a hammered and soldered silver-plated copper liner.\r\n",
