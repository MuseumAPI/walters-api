    "Description": "Chinese blue and white porcelains were some of the most commonly exported pieces to Europe, the Near East, and Southeast Asia. This bowl is an example of exported porcelain in the Philippines. The bowl is white porcelain, painted with cobalt blue covered in a clear crackled glaze. The inside and outside are decorated with a variety of alternating aquatic plants including water weeds, eel grass, and lotuses rising from rolling waves. Either side of the rim is painted with geometric patterns framed by double rings. The bowl has a narrow round foot and wide everted rim. Similar aquatic plant and wildlife motifs appear on blue and white porcelains of assorted form and function. \r\n\r\nFollowing a period of conservative porcelain production when blue and white wares were prohibited, the taste was revived by Chenghua (1465-87). The porcelain of this period was made primarily for imperial enjoyment and exhibits delicately painted designs on small contemplative porcelain. The outline and wash technique is produced for the first time under Chenghua and appears on this bowl.\r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial porcelain.  \r\n",
