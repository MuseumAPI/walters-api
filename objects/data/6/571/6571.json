    "Description": "Prince Rupert (1619-82) is here a mature man of the world in the regalia of the Most Noble Order of the Knights of the Garter, England's oldest and most prestigious military order. Rupert was an outstanding military commander during the English Civil War of 1642-46 in support of his uncle Charles I. He promoted commercial ventures overseas, pursued scientific and artistic interests (including development of the mezzotint print technique), and was an excellent tennis player.\r\n\r\nIn the 1660s Pieter Lely was praised as the finest portraitist in England. This is one of several versions of this portrait. The face demonstrates Lely's more deliberate modeling style in contrast to Van Dyck's; assistants executed the stiffly painted drapery.\r\n",
