    "Description": "In the mid-19th century, the dissemination of Romantic ideas and the rise of nationalism led to a great interest in native, or folk, culture. During this period, many local costumes and customs were rediscovered or invented. Observing the changes in these costumes as one journeyed from region to region became an essential part of the experience of traveling. Images aimed at tourists that depicted different types of people in colorful and distinctive clothing were produced in great numbers and in a wide variety of media.",
