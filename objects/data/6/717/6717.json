    "Description": "Syrian seals have a diverse range of imagery drawn from Mesopotamia and Egypt. This seal depicts the Syrian \"smiting\" god and a nude female figure standing on the back of a bull. Behind the smiting god is a Babylonian goddess wearing an Egyptian-style headdress. The elaborate borders and the detailed figures are typical of Syrian seals of this period. An Egyptian ankh and a Mesopotamian sun disk in a crescent illustrate further connections between Syria and its neighbors. The hematite has preserved the crisp edges of the carving in remarkable detail.",
