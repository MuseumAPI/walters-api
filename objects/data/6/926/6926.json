    "Description": "This miniature may be copied from a now-lost portrait of Marie-Antoinette by Anne Vallayer-Coster, who was one of the queen's favorite artists. Vallayer-Coster was celebrated for her still lifes, but she received several important portrait commissions from the royal family, perhaps due to the favor shown her by Marie-Antoinette. However, Vallayer-Coster's floral still-life miniatures are done with an exquisite technique that is far superior to that found in this portrait.\r\nSee Notes field",
