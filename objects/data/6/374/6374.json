    "Description": "This commemorative medal represents three friends--George Hermann, Konrad Mair, and Heinrich Ribisch--who worked for the great German banking family, the Fuggers. On the reverse are their respective coats of arms and a quotation from Psalm 133: \"How pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\"\r\n\r\nGebel, a gifted Nuremberg medalist, was able to introduce texture and subtle detail in low relief. Silver gives a sensuous warmth to the surface, but its softness makes it especially susceptible to nicks along the edges.\r\n",
