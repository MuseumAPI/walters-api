    "Description": "Made from a paper-thin sheet of gold, this appliqu\u00e9 (to be applied to another surface such as marble or jasper) is executed in repouss\u00e9 (pressed out from the back).  It is a virtuoso piece by Cesare Targone, a goldsmith born in Venice who was active primarily in Rome and Florence during the late 16th century.  This precious work may have been executed while Targone was in Rome, which would explain why it is stylistically close to the art of Guglielmo della Porta.\r\n\r\nThe use of gold indicates that the artist and patron wanted a relief of the utmost sumptuousness and delicacy.  Pure gold is rarely used because it is very soft, making it impractical for objects that sustain pressure; indeed the faces of some of the women have been slightly flattened.\r\n",
