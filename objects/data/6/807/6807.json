Pulzone has carefully rendered the textures of her luxurious dress down to the smallest details, including the refined lace of her cuffs and collar and the embroidery of the black dress.\r\n\r\nThe stately, formal, and somewhat stiff three-quarter figure, exemplified by Pulzone's painting, had become standard for aristocratic portraiture in late 16th-century Europe.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please seeFederico  Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 238, pp. 360-361.",
