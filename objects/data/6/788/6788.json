    "Description": "Eros, shown without wings, is masquerading as the child Herakles. The lion's skin is slung over his left shoulder and reappears beside his right thigh. He steadies an amphora over his left shoulder, one hand on the butt end, the other beside the handles. The amphora is awkwardly modeled; the top and bottom parts are not aligned. Eros wears a serpentine bracelet on his right leg, a bracelet on his right wrist, and a fillet on his head. The figure is finely modeled and, despite wear, careful attention to details is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe feet and right hand of the figure are broken off, and the surface is worn. The backside is flat and is notched behing the upraised arm, probably to facilitate attachment to a box or a piece of furniture. There are two pairs of holes on the back, one pair in the notch, the other higher up, none piercing the relief.\r\n\r\nErotes with amphoras over their shoulders appear elsewhere in Hellenistic art.\r\n\r\nIvory sculptural work of the Hellenistic period is uncommon.",
