    "Description": "Personal devotions directed to the Virgin were a natural part of life for Christians in Renaissance Europe, so a painting of the Virgin and Child of this size and intimacy was most likely intended for the home. Giovanni Francesco da Rimini followed the conservative northern Italian tradition of painting that was only slightly affected by the illusionistic innovations of 15th-century Florentine artists. In this work, datable to the somewhat obscure middle period of his career, the Virgin and Child stand out against a dark, flat background. Christ's eyes are rapturously raised to heaven, as if in contemplation of his future Passion. The rim of the Virgin's robe is inscribed with words from a prayer regularly addressed to her by the faithful: [Ave] Maria, g[ratia plena]. . . (Hail Mary, full of grace. . .).\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 139, pp. 207-208.",
