    "Description": "This small triptych icon is fitted within a silver frame and was meant to be worn on the chest as a pendant. The outside of the frame is engraved with floral ornament and has a small relief Crucifix in the middle. In the top register on the inside, the four evangelists surround an image of the Holy Trinity. On their two sides is the Annunciation. The scenes that follow are, from left to right, the Nativity, Presentation of Christ in the Temple, Baptism, Transfiguration, Raising of Lazarus, Entry into Jerusalem, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, Dormition of the Virgin, and Birth of the Virgin. These are framed by an image of the Tree of Jesse: Jesse, the father of King David, is shown reclining at it the bottom; from him spring branches that contain medallions with images of the Old Testament ancestors of Christ.",
