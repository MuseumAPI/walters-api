    "Description": "This finely worked plaque of the Virgin was originally placed on the left arm of a very large cross.  The outer border has decorative characters resembling Arabic known as pseudo-Kufic script.  A nearly identical psuedo-kufic border is found on a enamel plaque in London (Victoria and Albert Museum). The two plaques are thought to be from the same cross. The London plaque has an inscription quoting a little known text on St. Stephen of Muret, founder of the Order of Grandmont. This inscription suggests that these plaques were made under the auspices of the Abbey of Grandmont, one of the most influential patrons of Limoges enamellers in the early 13th century.",
