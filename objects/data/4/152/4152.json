    "Description": "This rice bowl, painted in varied shades of underglaze cobalt blue, is decorated with aquatic flora and fauna. Storks wade and hunt on the bank of a lake or river filled with lotus flowers and clustered water reeds. The bottom on the inside of the bowl is painted with a medallion of lotus flowers; a band of lotus scrolls decorate the inner rim. Outline and wash technique is utilized by the artist to apply the paint in controlled strokes and diluted brushy saturations which act as a darker background to contrast the white birds. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
