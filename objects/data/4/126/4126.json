    "Description": "On 4 June 1738, Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707-1751), heir apparent to the British throne, was a most happy man. For on that day his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe Gotha, presented him with a son who, he foresaw, would in turn inherit the throne. To mark the birth, he gave a beautifully chiseled gold snuffbox, with a presentation inscription, to Dr. Nathaniel Lee (1694-1755), who had attended the Princess. Frederick died before he could be crowded King, but his son reigned as George III.\r\n\r\nThe snuffbox shows Jupiter grasping a thunderbolt and seated on his eagle amidst clouds. The border shows floral festoons and two crossed braches of laurel. Round the body is a double line of flowers or shells. On the bases is a trellis pattern. The motif of Jupiter is copied from the design of Claude Audran III (1658-1734) peintre du roi, for the center portion of a tapestry from the set of \"Les portieres des Dieux, Les quatre Elements (Jupiter for Fire) which were ordered in 1699 and painted before 1702.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the cover is engraved \"The Gift of / Frederick Prince of Wales / To / Nathl. Lee M.D.\" This is English work, probably made in London, ca. 1738. There are no marks. In his will Dr. Lee left the box to \"Mrs. Sarah Beavis of Hatton Garden.\"\r\n",
