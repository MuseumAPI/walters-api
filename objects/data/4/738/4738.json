    "Description": "Delacroix often preferred to depict subjects from France's medieval past rather than from Greek or Roman antiquity. At the Battle of Poitiers (1356), a decisive episode in the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), John II of France was captured by the English forces led by Edward, prince of Wales, known as the Black Prince.\r\n\r\nThis preparatory sketch is for King John at the Battle of Poitiers, a large canvas now in the Louvre Museum, Paris. It was commissioned by the duchess of Berry, the daughter-in-law of France's last Bourbon monarch, Charles X. This sketch typifies the bold brushwork and vivid colors associated with Delacroix's early work.",
