    "Description": "This portrait of an unidentified man, probably executed in Rome, appears to have originally extended further at the lower edge. The object partially visible at the lower edge is probably a pair of gloves, often depicted in the hand of a gentleman as a sign that he does not do manual work. His Vandyke beard, so named after the famous Flemish portrait painter Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), was popular among gentlemen during the 17th century.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 3210, p. 449.",
