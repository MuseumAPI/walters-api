    "Description": "This necklace is composed of 85 hollow gold beads, the openings edged with twisted wire. The beads are threaded onto a chain made of double loops of wire constricted in their centers and twisted so that the end loops are in perpendicular planes. The bulls' head finials have a collar consisting of a garnet bead held between gold cups encircled by smooth and twisted wire and a row of tongues. Each collar terminates in a gold cone, then a ring of twisted wire, and is attached to the chain by coiled, hollow wire. The forelock and mane of the bull are chased; the inlay of the eyes is missing. One bull holds in its mouth the hook, the other the loop.\r\n\r\nChain necklaces threaded with gold or garnet beads and ending in animal head terminals were popular throughout the Hellenistic period.",
