    "Description": "This translucent green blown glass bottle, also known as a candlestick unguentarium, sits on a flat base and has a bell shaped body. The cylindrical neck, with a construction just above the body, tapers up towards the flat disk rim. Vessels of this shape, ranging from smaller, palm sized examples all the way up to larger versions such as this one, would have been used to hold valuable oils and perfumes. This form became popular beginning in the 2nd century AD and examples have been found throughout the Roman Empire but they seem to have been especially popular in the Eastern Provinces.",
