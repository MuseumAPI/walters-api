    "Description": "The ornamentation is typical of Italian tin-glazed earthenware, or maiolica, made in the town of Deruta in the early 16th century.  The motif of a heart topped with a coronet may allude to the vase's original role as a type of love token.  Italian earthenware had broad appeal and was exported in large numbers for use by the wealthy throughout Europe.  It took its departure from the earthenware made by Islamic craftsmen in Spain.  The name maiolica comes from the fact that the Spanish wares were sent from mainland first to the island of Majorca for export to the rest of Europe. This vase once had a conical lid with a finial to allow for easy opening.",
