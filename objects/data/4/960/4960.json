    "Description": "Rings with skillfully cut portraits of rulers were introduced during the Hellenistic period. This portrait probably depicts a Ptolemaic queen of the 2nd century BC; corkscrew locks in royal portraits are first seen on coins of Cleopatra I (180-176 BC). The hair style and the small crown or lotus flower on the subject's head associate her with the popular image of the goddess Isis, but the wide open eyes and the heavy chin are typical features in portraits of Ptolemaic rulers. Sources suggest that such rings were bestowed as gifts on esteemed military leaders or high officials.",
