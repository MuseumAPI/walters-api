    "Description": "During the French Revolution, Marat published a newspaper, \"L'Ami du peuple\" (The Friend of the People), that encouraged the public to resort to violence to bring down the monarchy. He was associated with the Jacobins, the most radical of the revolutionaries. In 1793, he was stabbed to death in his bathtub by Charlotte Corday, a member of the more moderate Girondist party. His assassination conferred martyr status on Marat for a few years after his death.",
