    "Description": "On the exterior is an idealized female figure wearing a wreath in her hair, while on the inside there is a similar image of a woman in a helmet.  By comparison with popular paintings by Simon Vouet (1590-1649), often adapted for the decorative arts, these paired figures can be identified as personifications of Peace and Victory.  Several examples of watches with idealized images or portraits surrounded by transparent green enamel exist. One is the only surviving watch signed by Pierre Huaud, the father, so the others have been attributed to him as well.",
