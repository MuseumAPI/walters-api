    "Description": "This small, undecorated manuscript was written in Geez, the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and was copied for G\u00e4br\u00e4 Giyorgis. Although it has long been considered to be a work of the sixteenth century, the scribe's hand suggests a later date, perhaps in the eighteenth century. The date 1308AH/1890-91CE, given on the verso of the second flyleaf could be for the Arabic notes of the two leaves. Evidence of its long life and variety of users comes in the form of notes scribbled on the flyleaves, with Arabic in two hands covering the front two flyleaves and notes in French and English on the back flyleaf.",
