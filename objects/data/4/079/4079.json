    "Description": "In 1641, Willem II of Orange (1626-50) married Princess Mary (1631-60), daughter of King Charles, when she was 9 years old and he was 14. The husband normally occupies the position of higher status on the left side of a portrait, but Mary, daughter of the powerful king of England, takes that position here. They join right hands as a mark good of faith, while rays of heavenly light and the dove of the Holy Spirit show divine approval. The inscription says that their fathers commanded them to marry. Charles wanted Dutch support in his civil wars, and the Dutch wanted status. The fine, raised detail includes the palace in The Hague where the couple will live.",
