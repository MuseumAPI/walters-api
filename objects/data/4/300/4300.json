    "Description": "Chinese export porcelain appeared in European markets as early as 1517, the year king of Portugal Manuel I established an embassy at Beijing. The Portuguese became a principle maritime power in the Far East, followed by the East India Trading Companies; demands were increasingly focused on blue and white porcelain. This plate is an example of export porcelain commissioned by the Dutch, including a scene and designs painted domestically with underglaze cobalt blue, black, and brown in the imari style and overglaze enamel decoration in red and gold (European additions). The central scene depicts two Dutch figures walking along a balustrade with a greyhound. Blossoming trees and flowers surround them. Leafy designs are painted on the cavetto while objects are situated between the foliations: a tall vase of flowers stands between a desk and a small dragon curled on a cushion, a Ruyi scepter is placed with a vase of flowers and a duck, a vase filled with peacock feathers stands beside a table with a bowl of fruit, and scrolls are paired with another flower vase. \r\n\r\nTransitional period (c.a. 1620-83) porcelain concentrated heavily on foreign markets and private commissions. The Manchu occupation in China closed the larger Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen, originally the capital of porcelain. The private kilns with private and foreign customers were able to produce high quality porcelain. \r\n",
