    "Description": "This print depicts a fairly typical poetry reading-except that sparrows are substituted for humans. A distinguished poet, seated before a folding screen, recites his poems for a private audience. His wife and children are seated near him. While most members are attentive, a mother turns to hush adolescents in the back row. In the upper left corner there are twelve \"haiku\" poems by different writers. These poets were probably members of a poetry club that commissioned Zeshin to design this print for a humorous New Year's greeting.",
