    "Description": "Anguier went to Rome in 1641 to complete his studies and stayed for ten years. When he returned to Paris, he brought several copies of famous ancient sculptures with him, including a statuette reproducing the so-called \"Flora Farnese\" (a Roman copy of a Greek statue of Aphrodite), which was much admired for its drapery. Anguier imitates the drapery of the antique figure in his statuette but replaces the severe face and proportions of the original with the face and form of a lovely young woman.",
