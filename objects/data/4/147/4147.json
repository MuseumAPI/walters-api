    "Description": "This is an appealing and exquisite image that forces questions about the nature of the development of Dvaravati art in the 9th century.  Among its most salient features are the alloy (which is brass), the punched curls, the oversided gem-shaped radiance over a low \"unisa,\" the straight mouth, and the pronounced rectilinearity.  For some of these, it is possible to point to external influences; others may be the product of an entirely internal development.",
