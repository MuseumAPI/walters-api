    "Description": "In this group from a carved altarpiece (Walters 61.148), Mary swoons in a visual echo of the dead body of Christ - her suffering paralleling his suffering.  The figures loosely derived from the great painter Rogier van der Weyden's famous altarpiece of the Deposition, of around 1442 for the Church of Our Lady Outside the Walls in Louvain (in present day Belgium). This piece was carved at the same time as its companion piece focused on the dead body of Christ (Walters 61.148). \r\n  \r\nVan der Weyden set out to imitate the three-dimensional modeling and shallow box-like space of contemporary sculpted wooden altarpieces.  The sculptural quality of his painted masterpiece made it in turn an especially effective model for sculptors.",
