    "Description": "Elaborate maiolica inkstands demonstrated their educated owner's taste and literacy. The hybrid creatures at each corner are harpies, female demons in Greco-Roman mythology that were at once beautiful and rapacious. A central rectangular compartment is humorously supplied with depictions of the writing implements to be kept there: quills for pens, a \"penknife\" to cut them to the right angle, and scissors to cut the paper. Triangular compartments on the side held ink and sand, to be poured over wet ink to help dry it.",
