    "Description": "Binary opposition is a central precept of ancient Panamanian cosmology, which viewed the cosmos as the pairing of opposites: male-female, light-dark, spirit world-natural world. The universe was composed of three levels-the upper sphere, the middle sphere, and the lower sphere. The latter was associated with the female domain and was mirrored in the upper sphere, the domain of the male principle. Decorative motifs, especially certain geometric forms frequently found on painted ceramics, likely had symbolic meanings, although their significance has largely been lost. Perhaps, too, some forms encompassed esoteric knowledge that was not intended for the uninitiated. Regardless, the dynamic imagery that characterizes the Cont\u00e9 and Marcaracas pottery styles is cognitive in its intent and likely reflects fundamental principles of indigenous religious beliefs and cosmology. \r\nThe pedestal bowl joins a round bowl with a pedestal support. Macaracas wares are characterized by dramatic, geometric motifs that have symbolic meanings pertaining to universal models, spirit forces, and related archetypal phenomena. Here the artist's use of strong black, deep red, and purple slip colors separated by a rich beige hue intensifies the visual energy of the design program.",
