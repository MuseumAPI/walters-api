    "Description": "The qero was the principal ritual libation vessel among the peoples of ancient Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile. This distinctive vessel form has ancient origins but became particularly prevalent during the Early Intermediate Period (100 - 600 CE). This dynamic time witnessed socio-political intensification and an increase in the numbers of political elites throughout the Andes, with an interconnected multiplication of aristocratic ceremonial events that emphasized hierarchy and authority. The ritual consumption of chicha (maize beer), the mildly alcoholic beverage traditionally served in qeros, was integral to these politically charged social events. \r\n\r\n A special goblet version of the qero is intimately connected to the \"Sacrifice Ceremony\" depicted on Moche painted ceramics, its shape being similar to the gold qero. The political importance of the qero is underscored by its renderings on colossal stone portraits of mythical founders that punctuated the ceremonial heart of the imperial center of Tiwanaku, Bolivia. These impressive portrayals effuse elite authority by their size, the sacred symbols decorating the figures' elaborate clothing, and the presence of a snuff tray and a qero held by each founder. Among the contemporary Wari in Peru, many portrayals of figures holding qeros depict a maize plant rising from the vessel. This iconic indicator suggests that the vessel was used to drink maize beer (chichi), an important ritual libation and offering. The maize-qero dyad also makes reference to the vessel's pan-Andean use as the offering receptacle for blood to be poured on the ground during rites to ensure abundant crops. \r\n\r\nThis libation vessel diverges from the typical qero's beaker form. The precious metal material also segregates it from the usual ritual drinking vessel made of clay or wood.",
