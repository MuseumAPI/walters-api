    "Description": "The distinctive Chup\u00edcuaro style was first identified at the urban center of the same name located in southern Guanajuato. The site was covered by a reservoir in 1948 to supply water for Mexico City. During salvage and later excavations in the region, pottery vessels and figures in the Chup\u00edcuaro style were found at sites along the Lerma River and southward in the vicinity of Lake Cuitzeo in Michoac\u00e1n. The Chup\u00edcuaro region had longstanding cultural and trade connections with the Valley of Mexico beginning as early as 200 BCE, indicated by similarities in ceramic figural art traditions from both regions. In addition, artistic similarities are found in objects from Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima, strongly intimating a strategic role for Chup\u00edcuaro as a pointof- transfer and unifying power linking Central and West Mexican peoples for many centuries. Burials of members of the Chup\u00edcuaro elite typically included a large number of female figures that conceptually link death with fertility as a central precept of the Mesoamerican ideology of death, transformation, and regeneration. Larger sculptures are hollow, but the majority are solid, modeled figures. Typically, the figures' basic features are defined by modeling; the ornately woven clothing and the striking body painting, a hallmark of Chup\u00edcuaro figures, are depicted in paint. Here a blank square is cream in hue. Whether this blank square represents a Chup\u00edcuaro aesthetic element or a symbolic form remains unknown.",
