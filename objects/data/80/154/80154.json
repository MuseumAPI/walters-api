    "Description": "This modern medallion is inset in the upper cover of a 20th-century gold-tooled morocco binding by L\u00e9on Gruel, Paris, which covers a 16th-century Flemish manuscript, Walters W.425. The medallion is a copy after one attributed to Jean Limosin in the Schevitch Collection.\r\n\r\nOn the lower cover of the manuscript the binder used an early 17th-century medallion of the sorrowful Virgin, executed by an anonymous French master.\r\n\r\nIn the original arrangement the Virgin would have been contemplating the resurrected Christ, according to the iconography of the theme, \"Et prima vidit.\"",
