    "Description": "The half-length figure of the sorrowful Virgin is turned three-quarters to the left. She is dressed in a blue mantle lined with violet, which covers her head, and a red robe.\r\n\r\nThe medallion is inset in the lower cover of a 20th-century gold-tooled morocco binding by L\u00e9on Gruel, Paris, which covers a 16th-century Flemish manuscript, Walters W.425. On the upper cover the binder used a modern enameled medallion of Christ, coped after a medallion attributed to Jean Limosin in the Schevitch Collection.\r\n\r\nIn the original arrangement the Virgin would have been contemplating the resurrected Christ, according to the iconography of the theme, \"Et prima vidit.\"",
