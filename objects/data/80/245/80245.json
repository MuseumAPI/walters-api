    "Description": "Nasca pottery artists excelled in painting dynamic imagery using a wide variety of slip-paint colors. They preferred relatively unencumbered vessel surfaces, so that the paintings flow across the ceramic object. Many images are those of deities or iconic references to religious ideology. In other instances, it is clear that the reference is cloth, a highly valued commodity throughout the Andean world, as is seen on these two drinking vessels. The energetic geometric patterns on the tall Nasca vessel, which dates to the end of the Early Intermediate Period (ca. 550 - 650 CE), have their counterparts in textiles that have survived in the dry southern coastal deserts as well as in painted renderings of clothed figures depicted on pottery. Nasca textile artists were masters of a variety of weaving techniques, including brocade, tapestry, and the difficult and time-consuming discontinuous warp-and-weft method.",
