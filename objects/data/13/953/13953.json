    "Description": "A hydria is a water jug with three handles, two horizontal ones to carry the vessel and a third vertical handle to easily pour out the contents. The main scene depicts a four-horse chariot, or quadriga, and its charioteer from a frontal view. Below the chariot is the word \"kalos.\" The adjective encompasses meanings equivalent to English \"good,\" \"noble,\" and \"handsome,\" and appear frequently on vases, often associated with a name. The term had an aristocratic connotation, which is visually represented here through the quadriga.",
