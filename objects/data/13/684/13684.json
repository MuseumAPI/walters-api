    "Description": "The multitalented Vestier worked in a variety of media, including enamel, pastel, and oil. He was accepted into the Academy as a portrait painter in 1786, but he was best known as for his fine work as a miniaturist. The sitter is his eldest daughter, Marie-Nicole (1767-1846), who married the wealthy miniaturist Fran\u00e7ois Dumont four years after this portrait miniature was made. She herself was a miniaturist and may have worked alongside her husband on some of the miniatures that are signed simply \"Dumont.\" Plain metal back with loop for hanging.",
