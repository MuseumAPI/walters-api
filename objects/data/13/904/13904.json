    "Description": "This figure of the crucified Christ was once attached to an enameled cross (now lost). The Savior is portrayed alive, symbolizing his triumph over death. His direct gaze and stiff body posture signal his divine nature. A long loincloth covering Christ's mid-section is lavishly decorated with bands of glass beads imitating precious stones, which also appear around his neck. These decorative bands, known as orphreys, were usually worn by monarchs or clerics; they are used here to indicate Christ's identity as the supreme ruler. Large metal crucifixes of this type were produced to adorn the altars of churches in central France.",
