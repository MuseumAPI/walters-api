    "Description": "In art, Saint Jerome is often represented as a penitent who spent four years in the Syrian desert as a hermit. To expel lascivious thoughts of young women, he beat his breast, and he grew spiritually strong through long hours of study. Though the saint is usually represented in his desert retreat, here he is shown in timeless isolation.\r\n\r\nThis panel is one of four depicting penitent male saints that may have framed a central painting of the suffering Christ.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 141, pp. 211-212.",
