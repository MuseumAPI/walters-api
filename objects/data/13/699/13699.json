    "Description": "This \"hydria\", a water-jug, depicts a battle from the Trojan War in which two of the war's greatest heroes, Achilles and Memnon, clash in the presence of their mothers, the goddesses Thetis and Eos. Each warrior has his chariot standing by, with charioteers at the ready. Inscriptions, in the Corinthian alphabet, identify the figures. The painter was obviously proud of his ability to write, a skill that was not widespread.",
