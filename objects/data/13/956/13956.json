    "Description": "In this scene from \"Linda di Chamounix,\" an opera by Gaetano Donizetti with libretto by Gaetano Rossi, Carlo, the nobleman, disguised as a painter, has returned to the village of Chamonix to find Linda crazed with grief at the thought of being abandoned by him. Here, in Act II, he restores her sanity by singing \"Hear the voice that softly singing...\"\r\n\r\nCarlo, suitably attired in Bohemian garb, carries a hurdy-gurdy strapped over his shoulder. His love, seated on a rock, is in the process of emerging from her madness. In the background is an Alpine peak, perhaps Mont Blanc. \r\n\r\nThe opera, set in Paris and in Chamonix, a village in Upper Savoy, was first performed in Vienna on May 19, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe small size of this painting suggests that it is a replica of the \"Linda di Chamounix,\" that was listed by Thieme-Becker in \"Allegemeines Lexikon der bildenden K\u00fcnstler,\" 11: 455, as having been exhibited in Florence in 1861.",
