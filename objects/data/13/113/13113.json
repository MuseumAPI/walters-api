    "Description": "This elaborate furniture mount is carved with a series of moldings at the bottom, and depicts a large putto set against a bank of waving acanthus leaves. The modeling of the figure is unusually fine, recalling Roman knife handles of the 4th century, with the rendering of the chubby body and face and the naturalistic treatment of the curly hair. Only the wings are stiffly handled. The acanthus is carefully rendered.\r\n\r\nThe panel is flat on the back. There are four chips in the acanthus leaves, and part of the base and the putto's left foot are chipped.",
