    "Description": "This soup bowl and tray were part of a multi-vessel stacking set that was gifted to a woman at childbirth, celebrating the birth--so important to the woman's status in the family--and her own health. The exteriors are painted with a continuous landscape to make the assembled set a cohesive whole, while the interior of the bowl and the top of the tray are more personal. They depict a bedchamber following childbirth and were seen only by the mother and her servants, as she used the pieces for food and drink during her confinement.",
