    "Description": "As told in the Gospel of Matthew, during Passover, Christ drove out the sellers of sacrificial animals and the money exchangers from the Temple in Jerusalem. Passeri imagined the Temple as a lavish structure in the ancient, classical style. Despite the chaotic, multi-figure scene, narrative clarity is achieved through expressive gestures, while the chastising Christ at center is set off by his halo of light. In Christian thought, the Temple of Jerusalem was a symbol of Christ. Luminous, light colors lend gracefulness to the dynamic composition.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 332, p. 458.",
