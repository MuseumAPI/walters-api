    "Description": "The lid of this small jar is held in place by a chain that passes through loops on the object's body and lid. Green stones at the chain's ends serve both as decoration and to keep the chain from slipping loose. The jar probably contained perfumes or cosmetics. The U-shaped curve at the top of the chain suggests that the container was hung from something, perhaps another piece of jewelry.",
