    "Description": "Vessels of the Geometric period (900-700 BC) are easily recognizable by their abstract decorative designs, which had their origin in woven textiles and baskets. While early period vases typically have sparse geometric motifs on a black background, the amount of the decoration increased progressively to the point that objects from the late Geometric period are often entirely covered- in this example, even the strap handle. Friezes on the shoulder and belly of the jug contain 16 fields (\"metopes\") filled with geometric designs like swastikas and rosettes, as well as checkerboard, zigzag, lattice, meander, and hatched patterns. An \"oinochoe\" is a wine jug with a distinctive trefoil-shaped mouth, which in this case would have been closed with a lid (now lost).",
