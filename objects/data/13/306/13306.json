    "Description": "The head of this crozier (pastoral staff) for a bishop or abbot shows the first event of Christ's incarnation. The archangel Gabriel raises his right arm in a gesture indicating his greeting: Hail Mary, full of Grace. He holds a scepter shaped like a lily, a symbol of the Virgin's purity. Mary raises one hand in surprise and holds a book with the other. On the knob of the crozier are six enamel shields, possibly the heraldry of an unknown patron. Three serpents fall headlong down the staff, showing God's triumph over sin through Christ's incarnation.",
