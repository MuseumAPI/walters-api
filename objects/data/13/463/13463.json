    "Description": "Spirals made of gold, silver, or bronze are common in Etruscan tombs of the 7th century BC. Their specific function is unknown; some scholars have suggested they are earring pendants, children's rings, or- most likely- hair ornaments. This gold spiral (like Walters 57.416) is formed from twisted wires and decorated with 20 hollow hemispheres that perhaps once held jewls. Human heads, their faces and hair rendered in repouss\u00e9, form the finials.",
