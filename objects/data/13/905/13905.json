    "Description": "In an episode from Ovid's \"The Metamorphoses,\" the hunter Actaeon, lost in the woods, stumbles upon a clearing where he sees the chaste goddess of the hunt Diana bathing with her nymphs. Mortals were not permitted to see her naked, and the punishment was death. The angry Diana splashes water on Actaeon, who turns into a stag. The hunter's dogs mistake him for their prey and tear him to pieces. On the plate, one of Actaeon's dogs has begun to sniff at his feet, which will soon turn into hooves.",
