    "Description": "During the early Medieval period, artists created sophisticated interplays between word and image. Often, the opening words of each Gospel would be intricately decorated, with the ornament and letters intertwined. Although the Medieval viewer would know what it should say and had no need to read it, deciphering the page, and thereby focusing attention on the sacred word of God, became an act of spiritual contemplation.",
