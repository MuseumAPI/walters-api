    "Description": "This apostle, enlivened by wavy hair and large enameled eyes, was probably attached to a large shrine or an altar frontal (panel) by means of the nail on his chest. He was likely fixed to a panel of brightly colored enamel, with a throne to sit upon, and a halo behind his head, like the twelve seated apostles on the high altar frontal of the Abbey Church of Grandmont (France).\r\n\r\nThe apostle arrived in the Walters collection attached to the cover of a manuscript (W.23), as depicted in the second photograph. The plaque was most likely attached to the cover in the 19th century, in imitation of the medieval practice of decorating book covers.",
