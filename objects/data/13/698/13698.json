    "Description": "This illustration shows when King Herod realized that the Magi were not returning to tell him of the whereabouts of the Christ Child, and so he commanded that all children aged two years or younger in the city of Bethlehem be executed. The slain innocents were early regarded as the first martyrs, baptized by blood. During the Middle Ages, the slaughtered babies were said to number 144,000, a symbolic number taken from the Book of Revelation. In this colored woodcut, the scene of slaughter occupies the foreground, while in the background the Holy Family has already escaped and are on their way to Egypt, where they would remain until the death of Herod.",
