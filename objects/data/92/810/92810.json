    "Description": "This thirteenth-century Psalter was made in Bruges for a female patron. Lively vignettes fill the calendar, while large historiated initials of saints trampling their oppressors introduce the liturgical psalms. Added Easter tables, as well as birth and death inscriptions in the calendar, attest to the manuscript's presence in England by the fifteenth century where it was extensively used by generations of the Touke family.",
