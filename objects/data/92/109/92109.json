    "Description": "This illuminated page comes from a sixteenth-century book of hours. The manuscript was made for the Aussem family in Cologne, Germany, a provenance proclaimed through family heraldry within the manuscript, as well as the arms of Cologne stamped on its original leather binding. Lavishly illuminated throughout with full-page miniatures and historiated initials, the manuscript is just as notable for the marginal decorations that surround the figurative scenes. Illusionistic jewelry, architecture, texts, flowers, and insects abound.",
