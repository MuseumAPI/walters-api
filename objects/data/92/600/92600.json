    "Description": "This copy of Macrobius' Commentarii in somnium Scipionis was produced most likely in northeastern France in the late twelfth century. The manuscript includes seven major diagrams, of which four are original to the manuscript (fols. 38v, 41r, 43v, and 47v) and three others, including a map of the world, were added early in the history of the manuscript (fols. 64v, 65v, and 66r). Additional minor diagrams demonstrating relationships in philosophical ideas or other concepts introduced in the text appear throughout the manuscript in the margins, added by later hands.",
