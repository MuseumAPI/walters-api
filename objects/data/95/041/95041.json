    "Description": "This small breviary, composed of more than 500 folios, is extraordinary for its length, considering it is the summer portion of a two-volume breviary for the use of Li\u00e8ge. The manuscript was completed for ecclesiastical use at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame and St.-Lambert in Li\u00e8ge ca. 1420. This attribution is suggested, for instance, by the petitions to the congregation of this cathedral (fols. 114v-117v), as well as the armorial shield of the family of Surlet de Chokier of Li\u00e8ge represented at the opening of the Psalms. The manuscript has modest, but interesting, decoration with historiated and decorated initials marking the liturgical texts, and occasional angels playing instruments in the margins. The most notable pictorial effect is found in the initials inhabited by transparent figures on rich blue ground. The technique is found, for instance, on fol. 156r with the gold monstrance held by translucent angels for the feast of the Corpus Christi.",
