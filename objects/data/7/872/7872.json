    "Description": "Although he never studied with Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824), Barye, like many of his contemporaries, was deeply influenced by this artist, who was renowned for his equestrian and racing subjects. After obtaining access to one of elder artist's sketchbooks (now in the Art Institute of Chicago), Barye freely transcribed some of G\u00e9ricault's most famous compositions, including \"Officer of the Imperial Guard on Horseback,\" \"Mounted Officer at Halt,\" \"Mounted Officer Holding a Second Horse,\" and \"Two Boxers.\"",
