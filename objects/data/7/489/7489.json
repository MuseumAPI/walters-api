    "Description": "The saint, wearing pseudo-classical armor decorated with scrolls, a winged helmet and embroidered buskins, his flying mantle clasped on the right shoulder with a round fibula, rides a white horse which rears toward the right. Beneath its feet lies the dragon which he has vanquished with his spear. A quiver of arrows is slung at his belt. To the left, in the background, kneels Princess Sabrina. Above her in the clouds an angel holds a shield charged with the arms of the saint. These should be: argent, a cross gules, but the enameller has transcribed them as: azure, a cross argent. The inscription S GEORGES is lettered vertically on the background at the extreme left. At the right rises a tree.",
