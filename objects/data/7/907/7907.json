    "Description": "Princess Charlotte Augusta, the only child of George IV by Queen Caroline, was married in 1816 to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, later King of the Belgians. The demise in childbirth of this popular princess in the following year resulted in public mourning said to have been unequaled since the death of Admiral Nelson twelve years earlier.\r\n\r\nShe is portrayed three-quarters length, standing frontally with her head turned to the left and her left arm resting on a parapet covered by an ermine-lined robe. She wears a high-waisted white gown and tiara. Behind her are heavy red draperies with gold embroidered borders, and beyond, a view of the landscape. A fluted column rises from the parapet on the left.\r\n\r\nThis picture, acquired as the work of Sir Thomas Lawrence and later attributed to George Dawe, is now known to be a copy of James Lonsdale's portrait of Princess Charlotte Augusta, in the Guildhall, London.",
