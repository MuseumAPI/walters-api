    "Description": "This panel was once part of the \"predella\" (bottom frame) of a larger altarpiece dedicated to the Virgin and Child and surrounded by Sts. Peter, Paul, John the Baptist, and Jerome. The \"predella\" panels expanded upon the legends of the saints portrayed above them. According to tradition, St. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, as he felt he did not merit to be treated like Christ. The building visible on the left side was known as the Meta Romuli and, until its destruction in 1499, was a landmark in the area adjacent the Vatican where St. Peter's martyrdom took place. The desire for historical accuracy is conveyed by the realistic attitude of the two soldiers, shown busily nailing Peter to the cross.",
