    "Description": "This small wine cup is covered in a delicate peach bloom glaze with a mottled pink-red ground speckled with grey-green flecks at the bottom of the body. The mouth flares open wide to expose more mottled peach bloom glaze inside. This cup bears a spurious reign mark of Xuande (1426-35) on the foot, six characters inscribed within a circle. The technique of peach bloom glazes dates to the reign of Kangxi (1662-1772), invented accidentally through attempts to revive the red glazes of Ming dynasty emperors Xuande and Chenghua. The marks of these Ming emperors appear on some early Kangxi peach bloom vessels.\r\n\r\nThe glaze's unique spotted and clouded appearance required the technique of blowing a copper-oxide glaze onto a clear glaze; it would then be trapped by a second layer of transparent glaze. As a result of inconsistent application of copper, areas which are thicker penetrate the most superficial glaze allowing the copper to oxidize and form green clouds. The pinkish-red spotting is also a result of a blown-on glaze.   \r\n",
