    "Description": "In ancient times, mirrors were made of bronze containing a relatively large amount of tin. This produced a bronze which could be polished to a highly reflective surface. Over time this surface has corroded, meaning the metals have converted to a mineral form, resulting in a mottled dark green patina. This type of patina forms over long periods of time during burial.",
