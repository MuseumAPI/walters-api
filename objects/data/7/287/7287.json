    "Description": "French clockmaking at the time of Louis XVI is unsurpassed in the delicacy and grace of its decoration and in the imagination displayed in its forms. Perhaps the most elegant shape was that of the lyre, derived from the ancient Greek musical instrument. It was introduced as early as 1758 and was employed for important clocks throughout the remainder of the century. The body of this example is of S\u00e8vres porcelain with exceptionally fine, applied, gilt-bronze ornaments. The upper part of the pendulum is formed to represent the strings of the instrument. The dial face is enameled with signs of the zodiac by the distinguished Geneva-born artist Jean Coteau (ca. 1739-1812), and is signed Kinable (active 1780-1825).",
