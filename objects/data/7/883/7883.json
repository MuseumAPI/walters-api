    "Description": "This single leaf, Walters W.904, shows a gathering of pleasure-seeking men outside a pavilion, where a number of women sit. The painting, which dates to the middle of the 12th century AH/AD 18th, was executed in northern India, possibly Lucknow. Some of the awaiting women drink wine while others attend to the hookahs. In the right corner, a man in yellow dress sits with betel quids, watching two men embroiled in a dispute, one with a dagger drawn. A second pair, at the far end and close to the pavilion, seems also to be enraged enough to draw blood. The rest wait in anticipation, smoking and conversing.",
