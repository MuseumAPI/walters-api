    "Description": "This scene is the famous armor-tugging (\"kusazuri-biki\") episode between the warriors Asahina Saburo and Soga Gor\u00f4 in the late 12th or early 13th century. Gor\u00f4 was rushing to protect his brother Tar\u00f4. Asahina held him back by grabbing hold of Gor\u00f4's armor. Asahina was so strong that the armor broke in his hands. The scene was part of a kabuki play and regularly performed in the 18th century.",
