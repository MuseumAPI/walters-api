    "Description": "The pugilist stands with his bare fists raised in a sparring position. Supported by a wide waistband, his tight breeches extend to mid-calf and have a \"two-button fall-down;\" his upper torso is bare. The ivory socle on which he stands is fitted into a gold mount. The mount is attached to an uncarved carnelian seal that serves as a plinth for the diminutive statuette.\r\n\r\nAmong the contemporaneous representations of pugilists in similar costume and postures is a group sculpture in ivory showing Tom Cribb and Tom Molyneaux carved in the 1st quarter of the 19th century.",
