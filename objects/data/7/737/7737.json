    "Description": "O'Conor, a native of Count Roscommon, received his academic training at Ampleforth, Dublin, and Antwerp. He arrived in Paris in 1886 and began to develop a looser style of painting. In 1894, he worked along side Paul Gauguin at Pont Aven, Brittany. He continued to work in a modernist style although he never entirely ambandoned external subject matters. This painting was at one time thought to depict a Brittany subject, but is now thought to be a late work executed elsewhere.",
