    "Description": "Found frequently at archaeological sites in Burgundy, these large, ornate buckles were worn by women and indicated the high status of their owners. The decoration, known as interlace, is fluid and seems almost to move, drawing the observer into the complexities of the pattern. As this style developed, sinuous, fantastic animal forms replaced the ribbons seen here.",
