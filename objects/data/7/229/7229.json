    "Description": "This red-figure stemless kylix depicts Nike and a king in tondo. She stands on the left in profile to the right, gesturing with both hands at her sides. He faces her holding a scepter upright in his right hand. She wears a chiton, mantle, and earring, and he a mantle; her hair is held in place by a cloth wrapping decorated with dots. \r\n\r\nOn the sides of the kylix Hermes is depicted pursuing a woman. On the front, Hermes rushes right holding out a kerykeion in his left hand. He pursues a woman who runs right, looking around. She extends her right hand toward him. He wears a chlamys and traveller's sandals, and has a petasos hanging down his back. She wears a chiton and mantle. \r\n\r\nOn the back, Hermes runs to the left, his draped left arm extended. He wears a chlamys with brooch and traveller's sandals; a petasos hangs down his back. He holds a kerykeion behind in his right hand. The woman runs left looking around, arms extended to either side. She wears a chiton, mantle, and earring. Her hair is held in place by a cloth wrapping decorated with dots. Between the two falls a sprig which she may have originally held.\r\n\r\nGods pursuing their loves is a common subject on 5th-century Attic red-figure vases, but Hermes is represented less frequently than many other gods. Since none of the women Hermes pursues is inscribed or has an attribute that reveals her identity, they must remain nameless.",
