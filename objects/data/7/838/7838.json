    "Description": "This bowl was decorated by Yabu Meizan at his studio in Osaka.  The exterior is decorated with an intricate pattern of hundreds of women engaged in traditional arts, crafts, and cultural practices.  They are depicted in multicolored enamels that have been fired onto the bisque surface of this six-lobed foliate bowl.  At the base, panels of flowrs ring the bowl.  The panels contain approximately twenty identifiable species of flowers including peonies,haydrangea, wisteria, morning glories, three types of camelias, lilies, etc..  The interior features a band of wisteria ringing the rim with blossoms hanging down into the bowl's interior.  Yabu Meizan's studio would purchase fired bisque stonewares from the Chinjyukan kiln in Kagoshima and from the Kinkozan kiln in Kyoto.  They would then transfer designs to the stoneware surfaces from pattern books held in the studio.",
