    "Description": "This well-known medal commissioned by Sigismundo Malatesta (1417-1468), Lord of Rimini and Fano, follows the format of portrait medals that had become popular by the mid 1400s, following the example of the Roman imperial coin in the stern profile of authority on the front, with a personal emblem on the back. The likeness was modeled in low relief. Taking advantage of the flexibility of the manufacturing process, the medal was produced in several formats. Although his domains were not large, Sigismundo was a very effective general and in much demand. \r\n\r\nThis example was discovered in excavations and the bronze has corroded from being underground,  resulting in a green, somewhat mottled surface.\r\n\r\nIt is inscribed on the front: SIGISMVNDVS PANDVEVS . MALATESTA . PAN[dulfi] F[ilius] ; [Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta son of Pandolfo.]PONTIFICII . EXER[ ] IMP[ ]\r\nOn the back M\u2022CCCC\u2022XLVI",
