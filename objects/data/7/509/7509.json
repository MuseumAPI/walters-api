    "Description": "Croziers, or staffs of office in the form of shepherds' crooks, were carried by both bishops and abbots. Carved on one face of the crozier are the Virgin and St. John flanking the Crucified Christ; on the other, the Virgin holds the Christ child between two candle-bearing angels. The fine carving of the figures is complemented by such details as the delicate vine leaves around the edges of the scenes. A few ivory croziers are known from this period, but the majority were made of pieces of rock crystal and enameled and gilded copper.",
