    "Description": "In this composition, the Mahavira is a towering figure who plucks his hair while standing, and the diminutive Sakra gestures like a dancer while seated on a rock. The strangely shaped decorative rock formation rises in successively diminishing waves painted in blue and white with red outlines along the border. Noteworthy is the use of red rather than ultramarine blue for the background and the complete absence of gold.\r\n\r\nThe second page depicts the birth of Mahavira watched over by the goat-headed yaksha Naigamesha. He had been selected by Sakra to switch embryos and make certain that the future Jina would emerge from the appropriate womb. Here again, the artist has departed from convention by including the god Harinaigamesha instead of the usual maid or midwife, who usually stands in front. Harinaigamesha, a protective deity of childbirth, is clearly playing out his role here by standing behind the mother, who holds the newborn in her arms. Other fresh details are the designs of the bed and the use of black pots rather than lamps below the curtain, which now runs along the entire width of the composition. Noteworthy as well are the larger size and more oblong shape of the panel, anticipating the format of later illustrations in manuscripts of similar subjects, and the varied tones of blue and pink. Indeed, the greater freedom of expression and absence of decorative excess make these two illustrations quite different from the more conventional mode encountered in other \"Kalpasutra\" illustrations.",
