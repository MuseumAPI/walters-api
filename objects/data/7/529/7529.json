    "Description": "Beginning in the 1500s, pre-measured, paper-wrapped charges were used by foot soldiers and cavalry. They were carried in special, water-resistant containers. Boxes of this type were worn on the front of the thigh for easy access by a horseman reloading his wheel-lock firearm. The embossed relief of two Turks fighting was created by the repouss\u00e9 technique (hammering from the back).",
