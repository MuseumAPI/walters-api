    "Description": "This drawing of the dog \"Betty\" and her pups was executed by Ernst Hasse. He was a student of Ludwig Richter in Dresden, and his debt to the older artist can be seen in the careful pencil contours and pale watercolor washes employed in this drawing. Hasse specialized in landscape and animal subjects, which seem to have had a particular appeal to William Walters. They appear frequently in Walters' collection, especially in the areas of drawing and contemporary painting, which were viewed in more private, informal family contexts.",
