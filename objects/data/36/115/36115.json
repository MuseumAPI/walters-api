    "Description": "The faceted square body of this vase resembles the archaic bronze \"zun\" ceremonial wine pot. This porcelain alternative is elaborately decorated with underglaze cobalt blue and overglaze enamels of red, yellow, green, brown, and black. A four sided flared neck is painted with five clawed dragons of varied colors flying amid clouds in pursuit of flaming pearls. The interior is painted with floral sprays, which continue on the dividing panels of the body. Four main panels on the body depict landscape scenes including standing figures, trees, blossoming flowers, rockery, or river banks. Keyfret runs along the foot in alternating colors. The diverse palette of enamels used in decorating this vessel is referred to as the wucai palette.",
