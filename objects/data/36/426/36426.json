    "Description": "The suffering Christ is a common subject for devotional statuettes.  Though Christ has here been stripped to his loincloth by his tormentors, he is poised and reserved. There are two points of attachment on the back of the figure, suggesting that it was once tied to a column.\r\n\r\nDella Porta relied on several bronze casters as well as gold- and silversmiths to carry out his designs.  There is another version of this Christ in silver, cast and finished by a silversmith working closely with Della Porta.  Knowing that Emperor Maximilian II owned a Christ (now lost) by Della Porta would have inspired a collector in Habsburg circles to obtain a similar piece.\r\n",
