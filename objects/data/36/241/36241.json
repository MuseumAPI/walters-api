    "Description": "The Mughal emperor Jahangir (r. 1605\u201327), like his father Akbar, was fascinated with the content and sophistication of European prints and drawings. The artists of the imperial workshops were encouraged to study and copy European works. Jahangir is said to have liked, in particular, images of the Virgin Mary, and this tinted drawing may have been made for him. Here, the Virgin looks affectionately at her child as he holds her hand and carries flowers.",
