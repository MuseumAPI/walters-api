    "Description": "These doors are decorated with ornamental, floral, and figural motifs that recall 17th-century Safavid-period designs; however, these were painted by Iranian artists more than 200 years later.  The motifs include men and women from the court, banquet and hunting scenes, animals in combat, and fantastic creatures; some are placed in medallions to give them prominence.  One of the male figures in the lower left border of the right door is dressed in Portuguese clothing, demonstrating Iran's contact with Western cultures in the 17th century.\r\n",
