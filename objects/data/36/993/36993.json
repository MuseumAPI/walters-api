    "Description": "The setting of this small painting is a brightly, though unevenly lighted landscape with a lake in the middle ground and high, rounded hills beyond. In the center foreground, two steers are locking horns in combat. Other cattle graze beneath trees at the right. The herbage in the foreground is rendered in meticulous detail.\r\n\r\nWhen acquired, this picture was listed as the work of Karel Dujardin (1612-1678). It was subsequently attributed to Hendrik Voogd (1768-1839), a painter from Amsterdam who studied with Jurriaan Andriessen before establishing himself, in 1788, in Rome, where he received the epithet, the \"Dutch Claude\" for his Italianate landscapes portrayed at dawn or dusk. Evidence to confirm the attribution to Voogd remains insufficient, but the painting is probably the work of an early 19th-century Dutch artist.",
