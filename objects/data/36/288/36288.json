    "Description": "Heinrich M\u00fccke, a student and later a professor at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy, was born in Breslau (present-day Wroclaw, Poland). Like Eduard Bendemann, he executed a number of important royal and ecclesiastical commissions for wall paintings. M\u00fccke was known for his deliberately archaizing treatment of religious subjects, which was meant to invoke what was seen as the purer piety of an earlier Christianity. A faint inscription on the scroll, \"Ehre sei Gott in den H\u00f6hen und Friede auf Erden\" (Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth), identifies the subject of this drawing as the angel announcing the birth of Christ to the shepherds (Luke 2:14). William Walters kept this drawing in an album that contained many works on sacred themes.",
