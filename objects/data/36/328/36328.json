    "Description": "A member of a distinguished Venetian family, a man of letters, and a patron of the arts, Marino Grimani ruled as doge of the city from 1595 to 1605. By presenting him in a stern profile pose and emphasizing his voluminous garments, the artist has captured the man's authoritative character. Malombra was a gentleman who devoted himself to the arts, poetry and painting, in which he followed the manner of the great Venetian painter Jacopo Comin, known as Tintoretto, who was much sought after as a portraitist. Malombra's social status allowed him easy access to powerful people in Venice.",
