    "Description": "Rings of this type mostly date from the 15th and 16th centuries and are decorated with papal arms, mitres, crossed keys, and other ecclesiastical symbols. Their name is somewhat misleading, as it is unlikely that they were actually worn by the popes, given the quantities that were produced and the inexpensive materials used, which would not appeal to the papal taste for precious stones in lavish settings. Therefore, it remains unclear for whom these rings were intended. Their massive size adds to the mystery, as they probably would not have been worn for an extended time. It is possible that they were souvenirs given out by the pope to pilgrims. This example bears the arms of Cardinal Gabriele Condolmerio (1408-1431), a cardinal's mitre, and a papal tiara.",
