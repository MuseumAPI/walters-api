    "Description": "Plaquettes hung above an owner's bed for devotional purposes were called \"images de chevet,\" or bedside images.  Here, Mary is interrupted at her prayers by Archangel Gabriel whose banner records his greeting \"Av[e] Maria\" (Hail Mary).  The lilies are a traditional symbol of Mary's virginal purity.\r\n\r\nThe modeling of the faces is in the style of the later 15th century, but the drapery folds set off against the diamond pattern on the wall look back a century earlier.  In addition, though much of the original paint and gilding survives, the frame was replaced in the 16th century.",
