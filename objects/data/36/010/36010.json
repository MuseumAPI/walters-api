    "Description": "Jules Dupr\u00e9's restless seascapes reveal the artist's interest in nature at its most dramatic, often depicting sunsets or scenes in which storm clouds gather and waves are whipped into action by the wind. This artist, one of the chief members of the Barbizon school, employs a low horizon line and exhibits his characteristic varied atmospheric effects. This style would later garner him much admiration in Impressionist circles.",
