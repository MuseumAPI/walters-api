    "Description": "The form and decoration of this vase is based on archaic bronze vessels, but differs from the archetype as a porcelain ware painted with cobalt blue designs. An inverted trumpet neck is placed upon a bowl shaped body that stands on a raised slanted foot. The body is painted with a highly stylized and geometric representation of confronting dragons, between them a spiraling pearl. This pattern also appears at the wide bottom of the neck. Mottled and spotted blue is applied to both. Between the dragons and where the two halves of the vessel intersect is a keyfret of coiled lines. The neck is further embellished with another band of keyfret, topped by plantain or palm leaves. The in-curved rim of the mouth is painted with a border of stylized Ruyi heads, named for their resemblance to the head of the curved ruyi scepter carried by certain Buddhist deities. Stylized Ruyi heads are also painted on the foot rim. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n",
