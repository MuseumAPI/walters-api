    "Description": "Turtles were attractive as display objects in Japan because they were seen as symbols of long life and happiness. These appear to be cast from actual specimens of the semi-aquatic species Mauremys Japonica. Each was cast separately, then pinned to the others.\r\n\t\r\nMurata Seimin was highly acclaimed as a master metal caster and was famous for these turtles. According to legend, the turtles that he used were alive, and one of his heirs suffered a painful death because of the turtles' curse.\r\n",
