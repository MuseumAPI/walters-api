    "Description": "Freestanding images of the Buddha had not been made anywhere in Asia before they were created by Thai sculptors in Sukhothai in the 14th century. What is the Buddha doing? It is possible to imagine that he is descending from heaven, where, according to legend, he preached to his deceased mother one rainy season. Or, he might be merely walking. This is considered one of the four postures: the others are sitting, standing, and reclining. In the Thai language, the walking Buddha is just called \"graceful\" (lila).",
