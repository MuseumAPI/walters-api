    "Description": "In the Christian East, priests and lay people have always taken Communion with both bread and wine (in the medieval West, wine was reserved for the clergy). The bread is soaked in the wine and presented to the worshipers with spoons like this one. Its inscription, \"For the prayer of Heliodorus,\" shows that such gifts to a church were seen as permanent, material prayers for one's salvation. The church at Kaper Koraon, a relatively small settlement in Byzantine Syria, owned numerous silver vessels, of which 56 survive. A holy oil bottle and a chalice were also donated by the same Heliodorus.",
