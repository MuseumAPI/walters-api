    "Description": "This demi-parure comprised of a brooch and a pair of earrings exhibits the naturalism prevalent in English jewelry of the 1870s. In the earrings bunches of grapes, rendered in coral beads, hang from twigs with leaves of finely chased, bloomed gold. A bunch of larger grapes in coral with gold leaves is mounted in the center of the brooch. Its stem is twisted and looped to form the framework of the brooch. The demi-parure has been kept in its black leather case.",
