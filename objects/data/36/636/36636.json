    "Description": "Finely ornamented belt buckles like this were worn by both men and women of high social status during the 7th century.  Complex curving patterns of incised interlace design fill all available space and characterize the ornamental style of the Franks and other Germanic peoples at this time.  This buckle was excavated at Tabariane in Aquitaine (France) in 1908.  A nearly identical buckle was found at this same site and now belongs to the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts.",
