    "Description": "Held by his mother, the infant Christ instructs the Evangelist Mark (seated on a lion, his symbol) while blessing him with his right hand. St. Peter can be recognized by his keys. By representing the holy figures interacting, the painter has added liveliness to the otherwise static representation of the Virgin and Child flanked by saints. The placement of saintly figures in an idyllic landscape is characteristic of Venetian painting, which is also known for its pictorial naturalism and rich colors.\r\n\r\nIn the Renaissance, a last name was often nothing more than the city of the person's origin. Polidoro was identified by his native town of Lanciano.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this piece, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 273, p. 400.",
