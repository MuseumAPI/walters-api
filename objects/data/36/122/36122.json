And Ummanigash, Tammaritu, / Pa'e, Ummanaldash, who before Teumman / exercised kingship over Elam, by his great command / he captured them. To my sedan chair, / my royal conveyance, I yoked them. / with his great help in all the lands, / I established order. At that time, the court of the Temple of Nabu, / my lord, with massive limestone, its construction, / I enlarged. May Nabu look joyfully upon it. / May he find it acceptable in the impression of its wedges. / May the order for a life of long days come forth / from your lips. Walking in Ezida / in your divine presence, may my feed grow old.",
