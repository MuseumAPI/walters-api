    "Description": "A gemellion (from the Latin geminus, meaning twin) is one of a pair of basins used to wash hands, both at home and during mass.  Water was poured from the spouted bowl over the hands and was caught in the second bowl placed as a basin below. This gemellion is adorned with peacocks, a symbol of beauty, paradise, and immortality in the Middle Ages. It is said to have been found in the Seine River and  is corroded from its long submersion.",
