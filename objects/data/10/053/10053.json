    "Description": "Thomas Charles Farrer was born in London and trained at the Working Men's College, where from 1854 to 1858 John Ruskin taught elementary classes. Farrer embraced Ruskin's teaching and on his arrival in New York, in ca. 1857, championed his former teacher's ideas. This drawing shows Ruskin's influence in the close observation of nature and meticulous detailing.\r\n\r\nThis drawing is mounted on separate sheet of paper. Around the drawing is a border, and beneath it an inscription in red ink. On the verso is an impression of the frontispiece from one of William T. Walters' two albums of American drawings. Given that this album was put together in 1859 we can assume that Walters acquired it at this time.\r\n",
