    "Description": "The inscription in German on this drawing tells us that a painting of the same size was in the collection of Mr. Wagener in Berlin. This painting can today be found in the National Gallery in that city. Its title is \"Ungarische Fuhrleute am Donaukanal\" and it is dated to 1828, meaning that the Walters drawing was completed after the painting. There are small variations in composition, most notably the dog in the foreground has moved from the left of the boy stretched out on the grass in the foreground to his right.\r\n\r\nKlein was a painter and print maker. This work is typical of his output.",
