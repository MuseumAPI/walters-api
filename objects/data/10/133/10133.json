    "Description": "We do not know the name of the painter of this plate, but his style of stark outlines and crisp forms is distinctive, and he can be identified as the artist responsible for a group of works centered on one depicting the mythological flute-player Marsyas that is now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan, from which he is known as the Milan Marsyas Painter. He apparently collaborated with the more famous Francesco Xanto Avelli in Urbino. The scene of Perseus and Andromeda is derived from a woodcut in a popular Venetian edition of Ovid's \"The Metamorphoses,\" which was used as a virtual handbook for maiolica painters interested in mythological subjects. Perseus, holding the head of Medusa, slew a dragon and rescued Andromeda, who had been tied to a rock.\r\n\r\n",
