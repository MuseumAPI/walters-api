In a rocky landscape are houses and flocks of sheep. In the second scene Joseph is sold to the Ismaelites by his brothers (Genesis 37:28). The camels of the merchants are on the right. Grazing sheep are seen in the background at left.\r\n\r\nThe two scenes are after woodcuts by Bernard Salomon, which were published in the \"Quadrins historiques de la Bible,\" Lyons, Jean de Tournes, 1553, and in various Bibles issued by the same publisher.",
