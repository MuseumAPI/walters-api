    "Description": "This design is a scene from the story of D\u00f4j\u00f4ji temple. The temple bell is shown at the center of the composition. At the right are two monks holding prayer beads and praying. A woman dances at the left, holding a mallet for striking the bell. The monks at D\u00f4j\u00f4ji used the bell to hide a traveling monk who was trying to escape a woman who was pursuing him. She thought he had promised to marry her and, in her anger at his rejection of her, transformed herself into a dragon. She coiled herself around the bell and killed the hidden monk by breathing fire on the bell. In the noh and kabuki plays about the story, a dancer, who is the spirit of the jealous woman, comes to the temple to celebrate the installation of a new bell. She dances under the bell and when it falls on her she is transformed into a dragon. The dancer is shown here as a fox. Foxes were commonly thought to take the form of a beautiful woman in order to cause mischief.",
