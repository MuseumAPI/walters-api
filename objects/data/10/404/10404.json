    "Description": "Monticelli, an artist from Marseilles, enjoyed a considerable following in the Paris of Napoleon III (reigned 1852-70). He specialized in pastoral vistas, such as this view of elegantly attired women relaxing in a park at twilight. The subject recalls the f\u00eates galantes, or outdoor scenes of amorous couples, painted by the 18th-century masters Antoine Watteau and Nicolas Lancret, but the unusual, rich colors and dense brushwork of Monticelli's paintings attracted such avant-garde painters as Paul C\u00e9zanne and Vincent van Gogh. \r\n",
