    "Description": "This fragment of the Virgin's head and bust is from a large standing statuette. She wears a head cloth retained by a band that is designed to receive a metal crown. She also wears a large ring brooch for which the Child reaches.\r\n\r\nTraces of gilt patterns appear on the neck of the dress and the edges of the mantle. The statuette is cut off at the waist and has a chipped and ragged lower edge. The Christ Child is missing except for his right arm. A wedge of ivory has flaked off in the center of the Virgin's face, destroying her nose. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to date this piece accurately since it lacks the characterisitic lower parts of the drapery, but the narrow eyes and expression of the mouth suggest a date in the late 13th century.",
