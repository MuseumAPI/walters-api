    "Description": "The carefully worked, pierced relief of acanthus leaves and putti make this porringer (shallow bowl with a handle) a sophisticated example of English silversmith work. The London guild marks (indicating that the silver content was confirmed by a trade association) are for 1674-75, while the initials \"R.C.\" are the maker's (otherwise unknown). Although Dutch maritime rivalries with England were fierce, by the mid-1670s, official connections were improved, and, in 1677, the \"stadholder\" Willem III would marry Mary, daughter of the future King James II of England. In this atmosphere, English luxury goods were a favored commodity.\r\n\r\n",
