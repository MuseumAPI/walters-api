    "Description": "Heald, as a young man, was a member of the firm of John H. Heald and Co., tanners, at North and Madison streets, Baltimore.  He married Sarah Malvina Allen (September 15, 1824-December 16, 1854) in 1844, by whom he had three children, Mary Elizabeth (1851-1935), Emma Eliza (145-1920), and James Allen (1849-1889).  As a companion piece, Miller painted a portrait of Mrs. Heald (WAM 37.2511).  The children were subsequently portrayed by another local artist, Henry Bebie.  Following the death of Sarah Malvina, Heald remarried.  Though he retired from the business at an early age, he took an active interest in a number of ventures, including the construction of the Mount Vernon Methodist Church.  Probably as a result of the business ties between his brothers Decatur and Columbus and the Healds, Miller executed a number of portraits of members of the Heald family.",
