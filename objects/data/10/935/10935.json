    "Description": "The 17th-century preference for naturalism led to the popularity of scenes of everyday life filled with mundane actions, such as people talking and drinking. Codazzi specialized in painting outdoor settings with villages or ancient ruins but not in painting figures. In this courtyard scene, Micco Spadaro, with whom Codazzi collaborated, painted the figures, as that was his specialty.\r\n\r\nThe cracked plaster of the walls of the inn suggests the passage of time, as does the presence of the majestic, ancient Roman portico on the right.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 340, p. 464.",
