    "Description": "While most disk fibulae are decorated with filigree, this one was made by the technique of repouss\u00e9, in which metal foil is impressed from the rear to form a raised design. The gilt silver foil, decorated with C-shaped scrolls and raised beaded outlines, is attached by four rivets onto a circular bronze base and set with four triangular-cut garnets arrayed around a green glass bead. The corroded remains of an iron clasp on the reverse once fasten the fibula to clothing and still hold imbedded wool cloth fibers.  A Frankish man would have used a fibula like this one to pin his cloak at the right shoulder.",
