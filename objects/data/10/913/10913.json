    "Description": "This painting is one of a series of similar panels that perhaps once formed the wings of a painted reliquary. The relics contained therein would have been those of the saints portrayed on the wings. On this panel, St. Lawrence and St. Sebastian are identified by the instruments of their martyrdom: the gridiron for Lawrence and the arrow for Sebastian. St. Christopher is portrayed ferrying the Christ child across the river as dictated by his legend.",
