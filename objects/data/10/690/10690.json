    "Description": "The 7th and early 6th centuries BC are known as the Orientalizing period because of the many eastern, or \"Oriental,\" elements in the art. In this prosperous era of international trade, Etruscan artists manufactured luxury goods, such as those seen in this case, that reflect influences from the art of the eastern Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThis ornamental strip of silver is slightly curved, with holes for attachment on each end, suggesting that it could have been worn across the chest. The artist created the processions of lions and other designs using stamps. Pendants of heads emerging from palmettes are attached along the lower edge.",
