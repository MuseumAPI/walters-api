    "Description": "The interior, on the right, Josue and the mounted Israelites charge against Amalec and his troops, who are seen on the left, some already turning their backs to the battle. In the middle distance is a camp with tents, and on a hill at the right, Aaron and Hur are staying up the hands of Moses, which were heavy. Shafts of divine light fall on Moses and Josue. The border is decorated with gilt scrolls on blue ground.\r\n\r\nOn the exterior of the tazza, three grotesque grinning male masks, one with a cusped forehead, the others wearing a crown or devil's horns are set in cartouches and alternate with female terms, amidst strapwork. The blue background is decorated along the rim with an ovolo line, elsewhere with gilt scrolls. \r\n\r\nOn the foot, the ground of which is black, are painted in brilliant colors heightened with foil two groups of grotesque sphinxes or dragons affronting grotesque female terms, and two squatting grotesque male terms. On the edge is a gilt continuous spray of leaves. The knop of the conical foot is gilt with laurel leaves now faded.",
