An obituary recorded that \"From the early times of 'anti-slavery' and 'abolition' in Philadelphia, Mr. Brown was the steadfast friend, counselor, spokesman and orator for the anti-slavery party. He was their chivalrous champion upon nearly all occasions, important and unimportant, in court, on the rostrum and in the newspapers. It may be said with safety that he never failed to answer their call.\" (See \"The Albany Law Journal,\" vol. 6, 1872, pp. 49-50).",
