    "Description": "The center of this plaque shows the \"Anastasis\" (Resurrection) with Christ standing on the broken gates of hell and pulling Adam up from below as a sign that the Original Sin has been redeemed. A kneeling Eve and other Old Testament figures wait to be saved. Above, Christ is shown as lord of the universe flanked by the Virgin, Saint John the Baptist, and the archangels Michael and Gabriel who pray to him for the salvation of humankind. Below, from left to right, are the apostles Peter and Paul, Saints Nicholas and Gregory the Theologian (wrongly named \"John the Theologian\" in the accompanying inscription), Dionysius the Areopagite and Alexis Metropolitan of Moscow, Stephen, George, Catherine, Sergius of Radonezh, and Xenia. The back of the plaque carries an image of the instruments of Christ's passion: the Cross, Crown of Thorns, Lance, and Reed with vinegar-soaked sponge.",
