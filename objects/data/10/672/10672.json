    "Description": "Petitot was a major French portraitist in painted enamel who learned the technique from Toutin. He was active at the English court until the execution of King Charles I in 1649. Petitot then offered his services to Louis XIV, and it is for portraits of the French king and his court that he is best known.\r\n\r\nHis enamels, with their refined detailing, soft modeling, and polished surfaces, suited the court's taste and had many imitators. Enamel was considered to be an improvement over oil or tempera for miniatures: the hard, lustrous surface was more durable, in keeping with the character of jewelry or other luxury objects to which they could be applied.\r\n",
