    "Description": "The inscription under the base of this figure states that it was made for (or perhaps by) Monkan in the year 1347. It likely represents a Shingon priest of this name who lived from 1278-1357 and excelled in the painting of Buddhist subjects. The sculpture's small scale, fine detail, and formal composition suggest that it ws made as a personal devotional object for use at temple feasts and other ritualized functions. It is carved from a single piece of Japanese cedar.",
