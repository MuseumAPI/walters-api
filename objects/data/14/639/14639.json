    "Description": "This portrait shows Ellen Harper Walters, the wife of William T. Walters and mother of Henry Walters (founder of the Walters Art Museum). She married William in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as \"Love at First Sight,\" and \"The May Queen\" (present location unknown). \r\nBaker seems to have found particular favor with William T. Walters. As well as portraying William's wife, he also painted their daughter, Jennie (WAM 37.1207). The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.",
