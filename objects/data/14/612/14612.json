    "Description": "The sitter is seen in profile, facing left. He has a markedly aquiline nose and jutting lower jaw. He wears his own hair, shoulder length and gently curled, and has a mustache and chin tuft. In addition to a heavy scalloped lace collar, he wears an embroidered sash. The Order of Saint Esprit is suspended from a ribbon about his neck. The portrait may represent Armand de Bourbon, prince of Conti (1629-1666). Armand was the younger brother of Louis II de Bourbon, known as le Grande Cond\u00e9, whom the bust was formerly thought to represent.\r\n\r\nThe ivory has been mounted on an ebonized wood plaque, the back of which is inscribed in ink: 779 trl, 451 TLL and 403 TAL. A paper sticker with the number 7 written in ink also appears on the plaque.",
