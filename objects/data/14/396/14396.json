    "Description": "This baluster shaped vase, with large trumpet neck and everted foot, is painted with floral motifs in underglaze cobalt blue. Blossoming branches set against a brushy wash of cobalt blue are filled with incised white magnolia blooms. Sprays of stylizes prunus (either cherry or plum) blossoms emerge from the rockery. The neck and body are nearly identical in height and decoration. The technique of outline and wash painting is apparent by the varied brush techniques and shades of blue that appear on the white surface of the porcelain. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
