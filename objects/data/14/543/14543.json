    "Description": "The rounded top and base of this box are covered in a mottled pink and red peach bloom glaze. Clouds of grey-green speckled with apple green rest on the edges of the curved lid and upper lip of the bottom half. Boxes of this type, in Chinese \"yinse he\", would contain vermillion seal-paste and were an essential part of a scholar's writing desk. The inside is covered in a white glaze.\r\n\r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table. While the French term peau de p\u00eache (\"peach skin\") has influenced the English interpretation of the glaze as emulating a ripened peach, Chinese interpretation of the spotted red-green surface favors the apple with descriptions such as pingguo hong (\"apple red\") and pingguo jing (\"apple green\"). \r\n\r\nThe spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
