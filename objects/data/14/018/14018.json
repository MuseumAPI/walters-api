    "Description": "Standing with the weight on the left leg and the right foot to the rear, with the right arm raised and the left lowered. There is a rather long beard, and the long hair on the forehead and at the back of the neck is divided into locks. The modeling of the face and hair is summary.\r\n\r\nThis statuette probably represents Poseidon because very frequently Poseidon has the right hand raised to hurl the trident and the lowered left hand holding a dolphin; while Zeus raises his left to grasp a scepter and lowers his right to hold a thunderbolt, which, except in early times, he is not hurling. This rule, however, is not binding.",
