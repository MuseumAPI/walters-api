    "Description": "The body is of Polykleitan pose and style, but with the head turned to the left. The weight is on the right leg. The right arm is at the side and once held a caduceus, part of which still remains pressed against the forearm. The left arm is held a short distance from the body, with the wrist bent. The left hand is now shapeless and no attribute is recognizable. The chlamys forms a loop before the left shoulder and winds about the left arm. There is a brooch on the shoulder. The hair is bound by a band to which two wings are attached. Part of a plaque which was cast with the statuette still remains about the feet.",
