    "Description": "In this altarpiece, its intact state rare for works from this period, the enthroned Virgin Mary, surrounded by angels, holds up the Christ Child to be worshiped. A monk, probably the donor of the painting, kneels below in prayer. The central panel is flanked by two side panels depicting the bishop St. Nicholas of Bari on the left and St. Galganus on the right. The latter is being instructed by the archangel Gabriel where to build his hermitage on Mount Siepi (in central Italy), and he thrusts his sword into the rock. St. Dominic, above, and St. Bartholomew, below, are represented on the left panel, and on the right panel is St. Francis of Assisi above St. John the Baptist. In the three pinnacles, Christ is framed by the archangel Gabriel and the Virgin of the Annunciation.\r\n\r\nRejecting the naturalism of contemporary Florentine painting, Giovanni di Paolo worked in a late-Gothic style reminiscent of the great traditions of medieval painting.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this altarpiece, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 79, pp. 121-122.",
