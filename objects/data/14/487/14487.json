    "Description": "This image from Walters manuscript w.106 depicts the Last Judgment.  Christ had said that when the Son of Man comes in his glory, he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him, all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, the sheep on his right, the goats on his left. To the ones on his right he will say, \"Come, O blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\" Then he will say to those on his left, \"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.\" The apostles accompany the Son of Man in heaven, while, below, St. Michael welcomes the blessed to his right, and, on his left, the devil pitchforks the cursed into the monstrous hellmouth last seen on the first page of the book, prepared for the Rebel Angels.",
