The miniature was painted for Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, n\u00e9e Nellie Custis on order from Thomas H. Perkins (1764-1854). The inscription on the back reads, \"Presented to Mrs. Lewis by her respectful servant, J.H. Perkins.\"\r\n\r\nAfter George Washington's death in 1799 many Americans wished to own portrait of the first president and revolutionary hero. Miniatures were a popular format for these memorials. This image is after a portrait by Gilbert Stuart, today in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown.",
