    "Description": "Vasari may have painted this biblical scene as well as three others (Walters 37.1177, 37.1705, 37.1176) in brown monochrome as a study for related compositions in a series of 18 larger, multicolor panels representing the correspondences between the Old and New Testaments made in 1545-1546 for the sacristy of the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara in Naples. Vasari's skill with the pen comes out in the preliminary drawings, visible in this work, to which he added layers of paint with his brush and fingers.\r\n\r\nThese particular subjects relate to the establishment of the Holy Eucharist (Communion), when the priest at the altar symbolically re-enacts the sacrifice of Christ. In The Fall of Manna, God provides food for the starving Israelites in the desert.\r\n\r\nFor more information on these panels, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 216a-d, pp. 333-335.",
