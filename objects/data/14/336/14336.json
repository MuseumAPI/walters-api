    "Description": "This beautiful thanka, painted in Tibet in Indian style, is a precious record of the period when the artistic and religious traditions of the Buddhists of India were carried to Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe monk with the peaked cap in the upper right corner may be Atisha, who arrived from India in 1042 and founded of one of Tibet's chief sects. This painting might be a copy of one he brought with him.\r\n\r\nShadakshari Lokeshvara, the principal figure in the thanka, is the \"six-syllable\" Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. When one who has been granted the right to recite a six-syllable mantra- \"om manipadme hum\" (\"Oh jewel lotus!\")-repeats the sounds of this spell, Shadakshari Lokeshvara materializes, and the reciter becomes one with him. Shadakshari Lokeshvara's joined palms suggest that he is holding a jewel, symbolizing that he, like a wish-fulfilling gem, eliminates suffering.\r\n\r\nThe lotus pool evokes the pond in the paradise of the western Buddha (Amitabha), where Avalokiteshvara resides. Amitabha is depicted at top center. Other cosmic Buddhas flank him, each surrounded by the rocks of a hermit's cave.",
