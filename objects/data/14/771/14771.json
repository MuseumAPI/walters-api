    "Description": "A \"three-string\" vase (in Chinese sanxian ping) is characterized by the three rings molded into the paste where the body and neck meet. They stand out from the mottled pink and red glaze that covers the entirety of the vase as three white ridges. A second title is zun ping, or \"turnip vase\" for the vase's high shoulders and tapering body. Distinct sprays of green on the mouth and where the neck meets the shoulder are a testament to the unpredictable nature of the peach bloom glaze during firing. This vase is the darker sister to another \"three-string\" vase in the collection [WALTERS 49.155], both purchased from the Morgan Auction sale in New York (1886).\r\n\r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table, including small flower vases, brush washers, and boxes for seal paste. The spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
