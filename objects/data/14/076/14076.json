    "Description": "In this enigmatic landscape a man in a small sailboat glides across a still pond. Discernible on the far shore is a couple, the woman seated on the lawn and the man standing, and beyond, some buildings dominated by a round tower. Deer graze in the woods at the right. As the sun sets behind the trees at the left the scene is suffused with glowing warm light. The foliage is rendered in minute detail with distinctive swiggly strokes suggesting a German or Austrian hand.",
