    "Description": "The left side is missing, and the roundel is warped on a vertical axis, rendering it concave from the back. Eleven holes (originally fifteen) at the perimeter allowed the piece to be sewn to a leather bridle. The relief shows in profile the head of Herakles, or perhaps Alexander the Great shown as Herakles, wearing a lion's scalp. Part of the animal's skin, including a paw, is slung over his shoulder along with a spear and a knotty staff. A molding frames the composition.",
