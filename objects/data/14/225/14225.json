    "Description": "A faience, mold-made amulet in the form of a small plaque with the jackal god Anubis recumbent upon a pylon shaped chest/shrine. There is a flail over the back of the jackal. The jackal and the chest are in raised relief. The jackal faces to the right and this amulet is the mirror image of Walters 48.1634. The glaze is a pale green except for the jackal which is bright blue. The lower and left sides are squared but the other two are rounded, roughly outlining the shape of the jackal and the chest.  \r\n\r\nNumerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as \"The Book of the Dead.\" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. This amulet has been modeled with a flat underside and is pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.",
