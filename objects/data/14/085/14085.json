    "Description": "This painting of Jesus' foster father is a study of the head of a bearded, balding man. The shadows of the face call attention to the underlying bone structure and enhance the sense of his old age. His biblical identity is indicated by his staff. Joseph was chosen from among Mary's suitors when his staff miraculously began to flower.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 422, pp. 532-533.",
