    "Description": "Helmets like this, that have preserved their original chain-mail \"aventail,\" or face and neck covering, have been likened to masks that conceal the face and create a sense of mystery. Their primary function, however, was to protect the wearer. Islamic helmets often were decorated with inscriptions that invoke God's power and blessing. Sometimes, as here, the writing cannot be easily deciphered and may even be meaningless-the presence of letter-like designs was evidently regarded as sufficient protection.",
