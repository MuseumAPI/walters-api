    "Description": "Around the cylindrical body of this incense burner is painted the Taoist god Zhenwu and a variety of other figures. Zhenwu can be identified by his bare feet, a sword he wields in his left hand, long hair, and armor. On either side of Zhenwu, figures with animal heads emerge from the water holding tablets of their rank. Four figures are depicted on the opposite side of the incense burner in an outdoors scene. The god Zhenwu, whose name means Perfected Warrior, originated from the 3rd century B.C. Dark Warrior Xuanwu, represented as a tortoise entwined by a snake and symbolic of the Northern cardinal direction. His anthropomorphic depictions began in the early Song dynasty, gaining popularity during the Ming where after 1304 he became known as Supreme Emperor of the Dark Heaven, Primal Sage, and Benevolent Majesty. Zhenwu acted as healer, exorcizer, and celestial protector of the emperor and the state and was worshiped through the Qing dynasty to the present.\r\n\r\nThe scenes, figures, and inscriptions that name the donors of this gift to a temple are painted in underglaze cobalt blue on white porcelain. A cylindrical body, tapering slightly at bottom, stands on three feet in the shape of lion heads. Diaper diamond bands above the main scene frame inscriptions and panels of branches filled with birds. The figures are part of a natural scene of land, water, scrolling clouds, and plants. An inscription dates the incense burner to the 31st year of the Wanli reign, 1604. Other inscriptions indicate the donation of the incense burner as a temple gift. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.",
