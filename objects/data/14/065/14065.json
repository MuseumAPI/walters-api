    "Description": "Having lost his wife Euridice to a poisonous snakebite, Orpheus, through his beautiful music, has made his way into Hades, the realm of the dead, to liberate his beloved. The only requirement of her release is that he cannot look at her before they have returned to earth. Impatient, he turns to look at her, and she is lost forever. This composition is based on a well-known engraving by Agostino Carracci (1557-1602).",
