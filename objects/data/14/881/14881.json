    "Description": "Two confronted leonine or feline animals, viewed from above, and a profile winged dragon with a human face and foliate tail fill the shaft of this letter \"I.\" The \"I\" is topped by red and green foliage and a frontal, bearded human face, which, although lacking a cross-halo, resembles depictions of Jesus in medieval art. The tail of the \"T\" includes a frontal, bearded devil-like face, painted blue and equipped with what appear to be horns. Perhaps the arrangement of figural and animal elements in this initial is meant to evoke the idea of spiritual struggle or the victory of Jesus, above, over the devil, below.",
