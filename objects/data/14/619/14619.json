    "Description": "The seated Virgin is crowned and holds a flower in her right hand. The standing Christ Child, who looks up at the spectator, reaches for the flower with his right hand. In his left hand he holds an apple.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy quality of the figures and the facial type recall the stone sculpture of Lorraine, but it is possible that the ivory is a Parisian work with Lorraine overtones.\r\n\r\nThe silhouettes left by the polychromed decoration include a floral border on the Virgin's skirt and a design of large flowering branches across the back of the robe. The rear of the throne is decorated with two tall, elegant trefoil arches, which were stained or painted and had a gilt outline, now in white silhouette. The flower is a restoration.",
