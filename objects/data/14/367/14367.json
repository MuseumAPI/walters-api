The decoration is aligned in one plane around the outer edge of the hoop. At each side is a conical garnet in a flat-backed setting; at the bottom are three pearls hung from rings; between the pearls and garnet are four rows of balls, six to a row, the center row concealing the fourth behind it. Hoops and balls are liberally sprinkled with granulation on the front side only. Within the hoop is a disk with the face of Eros framed by twisted wire.",
