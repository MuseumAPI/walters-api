    "Description": "This jar is painted with figures and designs in underglaze cobalt blue. The Eight Taoist Immortals, identifiable by their physical features, dress, and the attributes in their hands, walk in procession over sea waves. The base is painted with stylized sprays of clouds from the waves while a scalloped arabesque floral design around the rim releases a canopy of swirling clouds that alternate between each figure. The jar is a globular shape, the body tapering slightly to a round foot and an open round rimmed mouth and may have contained dry tea. A similar tea jar painted with The Eight Taoist Immortals can be found in the Walters collection [WALTERS 49.1525]. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain. During the reign of Wanli (1573-1619) corrupt exploitation of the Jingdezhen kilns for economic reasons led to an increase in private kiln production, patronage and subsequently the quality of blue and white porcelain. \r\n",
