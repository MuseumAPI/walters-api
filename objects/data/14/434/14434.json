    "Description": "Constantine was the first Christian Emperor of Rome; his dramatic conversion and military victories made him the ideal Christian soldier. He is shown in prayer, surrounded by an inscription that translates, \"I commend myself to God.\" This is a \"piatto di pompe,\" or ceremonial dish, distinguished by its impressive size and skillful decoration. In the 16th century, a group of these large dishes could take the place of fine metal vessels on a sideboard display. Painted in cobalt blue and gold-colored luster, it reveals the influence of Hispano-Moresque pottery.",
