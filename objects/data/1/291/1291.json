    "Description": "In 1224, Saint Francis of Assisi was meditating on the mountainside of La Verna in the Apennine Mountains of Italy on the sufferings of Christ when a seraph (an angel of the highest order) appeared to him in a vision of light. Afterwards, he found his hands, feet, and side marked with the wounds of Christ-the stigmata. The miracle is shown here as witnessed by Saint Francis's companion, Brother Leo. To remind the viewer that Saint Francis was the founder of the Franciscan Order, the artist has transformed his rustic chapel into a grand basilica. The almost organic shapes of the rocks express the belief that rocks, like plants, actually grew from the ground.\r\n\r\nThis panel is part of a large altarpiece that Marco Zoppo executed in Venice in 1471 for a church in the city of Pesaro.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 140, pp. 208-211.",
