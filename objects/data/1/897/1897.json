    "Description": "Situlae were vessels used to pour offerings of milk or water in purification rituals. They take the form of a human breast and were associated with the goddess Isis. \r\nSitulae were found in temple treasuries at Amarna, the city built by the pharaoh Akhenaten to honor Aten, the sun-disk deity. \r\n\r\nThis vessel continued to be used after the demise of Akhenaten and the king's birth name has been erased. It has a central field containing three columns of inscription executed in dark blue glaze.",
