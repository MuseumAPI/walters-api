    "Description": "These two panels are the wings from a private devotional triptych (three-panel painting). In the Last Judgment scene, Christ arrives in glory to judge the dead, who rise from their tombs expressing hope, awe, and fear. Christ's right hand is turned palm upward to indicate that those on his right side will be saved, while his down-turned left hand is aligned with the mouth of hell, into which a devil drags a female sinner by her hair. Look closely at the Crucifixion; at least eleven angels once surrounded Christ's body. Free-hand drawings of their haloes and bodies can still be seen scratched into the gold ground.\r\n\r\nFor more information on these panels, please see Zeri catalogue number 5, pp. 10-11.",
