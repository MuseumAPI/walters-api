    "Description": "A two-handed sword could span up to 6 ft. in length. It was initially a specialized weapon for the infantry, used for cutting or thrusting, to penetrate the enemy's front line. After the introduction of firearms to the battlefield by the end of the 1500s, the role of the two-handed sword was generally limited to the ceremonial use of bodyguards and civic militia.\r\n\r\nThe maker's mark on the blade is similar to ones used by bladesmiths in Munich.\r\n",
