    "Description": "This vase and its mate demonstrate the extraordinarily high quality of production maintained at the S\u00e8vres Manufactory during the early 19th century. Their shape, known as \"carafe \u00e9trusque,\" was based on that of ancient vessels collected by Dominique Vivant, baron of Denon, during his service at the French embassy in Rome prior to the French Revolution. Nicolas-Marie Moriot, a figure-painter at S\u00e8vres, based his images of the reigning King Louis-Philippe and Queen Marie-Am\u00e8lie on prints after Franz Xaver Winterhalter's portraits of the monarch and his wife. The rich decoration of palmettes, rosettes, and flower-forms is painted in gold and platinum.\r\n",
