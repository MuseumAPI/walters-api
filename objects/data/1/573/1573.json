    "Description": "This fibula is one of a pair crafted in a workshop in northern France. The peacock likely reflects Roman or Byzantine influence, as it is not native to northern France. In early Christian art, the peacock was a symbol of immortality. Knowledge of the bird could have passed to northern France through the transmission of Christian iconography in textiles, books, and other portable objects. The fibula originally was one of a pair of brooches worn by women on either side of the chest. A second gold peacock fibula, plausibly the mate to Walters 57.570, belongs to the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.",
