    "Description": "Monogrammed \"S. C.\" in gold letters near the top of the left edge, this devotional plaque is by Suzanne de Court, the only woman enamel painter to sign her work (sometimes in full), but no dated pieces are known. Based on the same source as the Annunciation plaque by Jean Limosin (Walters 44.346), this piece is notable for the brilliance of the translucent enamel colors, especially the garnet red, and the delicately applied gilding, although the overall emphasis on surface pattern, dazzling though it is, nearly flattens out the space.",
