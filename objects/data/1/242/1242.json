He has chosen an oval format and has applied the pigments extremely thinly in smooth brush strokes, as was characteristic of many of his mature works. Other self-portraits include a small oil sketch on academy board painted about 1827, a pencil sketch probably made during his western trip in 1837, and a later work showing him as a bearded individual.",
