    "Description": "St. Francis of Assisi (ca. 1182-1226), easily identified by the stigmata--wounds on his hands and feet parallel to those on the body of the crucified Christ--that he received as a special sign of grace, meditates in front of a crucifix.  Nathan, a little-known but fine silversmith from Augsburg, took care to bring out details that give the saint a living presence, such as the veins on his elegantly elongated hands and neck.",
