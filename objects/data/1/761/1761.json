Classical and mythological elements were significant during his epoch, giving furniture of this period classical motifs. Many cabinets were imported into France from Italy in large numbers during the 17th century and played a large role in developing the style of French cabinet makers. For another fine example of French cabinetry at the Walters Art Museum see 65.19.",
