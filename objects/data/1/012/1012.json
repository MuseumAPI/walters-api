    "Description": "Corot traveled frequently throughout his life. He regularly visited the small village of Marissel, some 40 miles northeast of Paris, including a brief visit in June 1857, when he painted this work. Corot's reputation has always rested principally on his mastery in depicting light. This work highlights his ability to render with feathery brush strokes the diaphanous light of early morning mist as it envelops a line of poplars and willows.",
