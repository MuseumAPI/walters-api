    "Description": "The pax is set with an enameled plaque divided into two subjects: below, Christ, as the Man of Sorrows, standing resurrected in the tomb between the Virgin and St. John, and in front of the instruments of the Passion: the cross, the lance and the whip. In the lunette above appears God the Father, wearing the cross-nimbus, holding the globe, blessing and surrounded by cherubs, a composition typical of the paxes of Venice and Padua.\r\n\r\nThe frame is original. It consists of pilasters decorated with vases of flowers, crowned by capitals. The lunette, framed in a deep molding, is set, as is the lintel below, with cabochons of glass-paste, and decorated on its outer edge with a candelabrum at the summit and dolphins flanking acanthus leaves on the sides.",
