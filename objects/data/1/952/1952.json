    "Description": "In 1880, Sisley moved from Paris to Veneux-Nadon, a few miles southeast of Fontainebleau, and remained in the region for the rest of his life. This view is one of several showing Saint-Mamm\u00e8s, a port town for barge traffic where the Seine and Loing Rivers meet, that Sisley painted at different times of the day from approximately the same location. By the 1880s, the artist had adopted a vigorous style, applying the pigments in rich, dense strokes.",
