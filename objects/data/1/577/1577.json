    "Description": "Lan Ying was one of the most important and prolific painters of the 17th century. He became known as the last master of the Zhe [Che] school. As a professional painter who was born in Zhejiang [Che-chiang] province, this was a logical way to classify him, but he studied Northern Song [Sung] and Yuan [Y\u00fcan] Dynasty models so assiduously that there is little of the Southern Song [Sung] wet-brush manner characteristic of the Zhe [Che] school evident in his paintings. \r\n\r\nIn 1664, Lan Ying was seventy-nine years old. Other than this hanging scroll, his latest recorded painting dates from 1660, four years earlier. The elderly artist is known to have been in Peking in the early 1660s, where in 1662 the Kangxi emperor came to the throne; perhaps this painting was executed there.",
