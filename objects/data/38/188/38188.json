    "Description": "Chakrasamvara (an identification deity) and Vajravarahi are at the center, surrounded by an eight-petaled lotus. In the petals, goddesses alternate with vases of immortality. Outside the square courtyard is a ring with eight different cremation grounds, each with a stupa, a mahasiddha, predatory animals, corpses and bones, its own tree, and one of the kings of the eight directions of the compass. Notice the different colors for the different directions. Because there are no lineages of teachers depicted, this mandala may have been made for use in a ceremony: it was placed upon a flat surface and was entered symbolically by the initiate.",
