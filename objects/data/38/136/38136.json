Michiel Verbist, who monogrammed it on the underside, had aristocratic clients in England as well as in the Netherlands. The engraved plaques on the exterior represent personifications of music while the drawers are decorated with scenes of rural peasant life such as hunting rabbits. On the open book held by the woman with the horn is inscribed what may be the name of the engraver: IAN\u2026/ H\u2026.",
