    "Description": "Although the Achaemenids used stamp seals for private documents, cylinder seals continued to be used for official royal business. This seal depicts the king fighting a lion-griffin in two scenes. First, he engages in close combat with the lion-griffin. Second, the king, standing on a reclining sphinx, aims his bow at the mythical beast, also standing on a sphinx. Between them is the benign god Ahura Mazda in an oval cartouche, with a winged disk above.",
