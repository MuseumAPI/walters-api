    "Description": "Zeus in the form of a bull carries off Europa who rides on his back, left hand on his head, legs turned towards the rear. Her cloak, held over her head, flies in the breeze.\r\n\r\nThe upper corners of the plaque and the ledge beneath Europa's feet are broken away. The plaque probably decorated a box, and was secured by pins through two holes flanking Europa's waist and by a grooved frame into which the projecting edges of the background of the relief fit. Typologically this plaque is related to Walters 71.596.",
