    "Description": "This double lobed gourd shaped vase is one of a pair; together they are elements in a garniture, a set of five to seven Chinese porcelain vessels displayed over doors or mantels. Garniture sets were often produced for foreign markets in Europe. These vases are painted with shades of cobalt blue beneath the glaze and are divided into two sections of decoration. The upper portion includes three quatrefoil medallions containing sprays of blossoming prunus branches with birds. The lower section contains quadrupeds in varied frames; an elephant is depicted in a pomegranate frame, a lion with one foot on a ball stands in a ficus-leaf medallion and the mystical and chimerical qilin is depicted in a palm leaf. The two halves are divided by bands of zigzag patterns. A floral ground of large blossoms and intricate in-fill of tiny leaves appears on both halves. Stylized chrysanthemum scrolls act as borders to the upper rim and the foot. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
