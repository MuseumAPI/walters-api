    "Description": "The Aeneid plaques are the earliest known Limoges enamels which deal with a classical subject. This plaque pictures King Latinus seated with his hands folded, unwilling to declare war on Aeneas and his companions who have just landed in Italy. The goddess Juno, however, an enemy of the Trojans, is about to open the gates of the temple of the god of war, Janus, while Latinus' men proceed with sounding their trumpets, readying their body armor, tempering their swords, and forging new weapons (Aeneid, VII, vv. 601-640). \r\n\r\nThis plaque is part of a series whose designs were based upon the woodcut illustrations of an edition of Virgil, \"Opera,\" edited by Sebastian Brant and printed by Johann Gr\u00fcninger in Strasbourg, September 9, 1502 (84th illustration, fol. 303 vo). The same cuts appeared in an edition issued at Lyons in 1517 by Sacon.",
