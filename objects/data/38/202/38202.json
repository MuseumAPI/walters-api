    "Description": "This small image follows the Sihing iconography- gem radiance, short mantle, \"vajrasana,\" right hand on the knee.  It has few if any of the stylistic qualities of the 15th-16th century manifestations of the Sihing, however.  The treatment of the facial features may appear to have a folksy quality, but nevertheless the sculptor is in control of the modeling and quite capable of deciding when a straighforwardly graceful curve is in order and when something more quirky is preferable.",
