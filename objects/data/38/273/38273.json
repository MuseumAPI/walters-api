    "Description": "The style of the composition suggests that this plaque, like its companion, \"Plaque with the Resurrection of Christ\" (Walters 44.345), is based on an engraving after a design by the Flemish painter Martin de Vos (1532-1603); however, a specific model has not been identified. The Latin inscription translates, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"\r\n\r\nJean Limosin signed this finely worked piece and dated it 1605. His effort to balance the definition of space with the decorative qualities of the enamel can be contrasted to the frankly decorative approach of Suzanne de Court's treatment of the same composition to the right. His handling of the translucent enamel is not as subtle. The frames on the companion plaques are original and indicate that they were hung as independent works of art.",
