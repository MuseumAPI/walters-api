    "Description": "In a clear nod to the modern world of design, Hazan's white-tipped bamboo leaves appear to wrap the surface of this large jar. The green of the leaves and the rich blue of the small patches between them are given their color through staining of the porcelain clay; the white leaf tips show the color of the unstained porcelain. The play of dramatic shapes and strong colors animates the surface of the vase. It appears to swell, as though its contents are pushing out against the constraining layers of leaves.\r\n\r\nItaya Hazan was the first potter to be awarded Japan's Order of Cultural Merit. This honor recognized his pivotal role in lifting Japanese pottery to a new level of international respect as a fine art.",
