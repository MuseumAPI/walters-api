    "Description": "The severe costume with its high, closed neck, starched ruff, and discretely ribbed sleeves, along with a pointed goatee in the Spanish fashion suggest that the sitter is a wealthy Spaniard or Fleming attached to the government of the Spanish governor in Brussels. There were many Spanish noblemen and men from the rising middle class who served the Spanish royal governor or who were involved in overseas trade.\r\n\r\nFloris is chiefly known for his figure paintings, but he was also a subtle portraitist, his brushwork looser than the meticulous brushwork of many Flemish portraitists.",
