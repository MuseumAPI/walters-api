    "Description": "A shaft of sunlight illuminates this scene in which five hens and a rooster are portrayed on masonry steps in the corner of a straw-strewn yard. The artist has carefully delineated the variations in the poultry. As early as the late 1840s Jacque began to produce these small poulaillers. A major example of his work in this genre is \"La Sieste,\" illustrated in Jules Claretie, \"Catalogue des tableaux, \u00e9tudes peintes,\" Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, November, 1894, no. 24.",
