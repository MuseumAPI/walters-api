    "Description": "In Shingon or \"true word\" Buddhism, considered an esoteric sect because its doctrines were secretly passed on from master to pupil, monks mentally enter a \"mandala\" (a circle of deities) and become each of the deities through inner concentration. The identity of this Buddha is uncertain. He may be the Buddha of the northern direction in the Diamond Mandala of the Shingon Buddhists, standing for nirvana and for perseverance in the conversion of all beings to the doctrines of Buddhism. It is also possible that he is Amida, the Buddha of the western paradise.",
