The rim and the intervals between the flutes are blue, with floral ornaments in gilding. The bottom of the bowl is of a white ground, embossed with eighteen gadroons, alternately blue and green, tapering towards the center with their arched tops spaced between the separations of the flutes above them. The gilt ornaments are the same as on the upper part. At the inner center of the bowl is an applied medallion of enamel, remade by Andr\u00e9 in Paris at the end of the 19th century, with the arms of the Mocenigo family: gules, a chevron azure, between three quatrefoils azure. The vasiform stem is blue, with eight white flutes in relief on the lower curve. The foot consists of a bell-shaped upper part, green, with floral and other ornaments in gilding, and of a depressed base, blue, decorated with a gilt scroll between two bands of running foliage. It is held in a copper-gilt rim. The inside of the foot is blue.",
