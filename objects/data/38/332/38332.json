    "Description": "This plaque along with its companion (Walters 44.628) once adorned a bishop's miter. Other plaques might have included figures which were also part of the deesis row of an iconostasis: Christ enthroned, John the Baptist, and the Mother of God. The archangels are rendered in high relief repouss\u00e9 and applied to the plaques with small flanges. Their mantles are covered in transparent enamel, one emerald green and one blue. The freely executed floral motif on the skirts of the saints' vestments and around the borders, as well as the pink, green, and black color combination, are frequently seen in other objects created at the turn of the 18th century.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the archangels, their haloes, and the border ornament, not covered with enamel, are all finely chased.",
