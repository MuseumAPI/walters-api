    "Description": "Pheasants were appreciated in China for their striking tail feathers, making them symbols of beauty. These feathers were collected and adorned military helmets as an indication of rank. The paired pheasants painted in underglaze blue, red, and brown on this white porcelain bowl also act as a symbol of fidelity. Prunus branches on either side of the pheasants perched on craggy rocks are painted with similar pigments. Touches of overglaze green enamel are applied to the scene and the pheasants. Sprigs of peony sprouting from the rockery compliment the pheasants as symbols of beauty, affection, love, and honor. The round bowl stands on a short foot rim and has an open rimmed mouth. Two double ring borders in blue underglaze are painted above and below the natural scene depicted on the body. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
