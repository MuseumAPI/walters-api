    "Description": "This vase is in the form of an ancient bronze wine vessel called a \"gu\" and consists of a white porcelain body painted in underglaze cobalt blue. Six prominent serrated ridges project vertically from the barrel bulge in the center and continue down the sloped sides of the raised foot. The trumpet shaped mouth is fashioned with two handles in the shape of grotesque lion heads, channeled at the mouths for rings. Swirling scrolls of stylized lotus blossoms and spiky leaves are painted on the external surface. A border of crested waves surrounds the foot, a band of vines bearing fruit cover the shoulders, and a framed panel beneath the upper rim is inscribed with the Wanli reign mark. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain. During the reign of Wanli (1573-1619) corrupt exploitation of the Jingdezhen kilns for economic reasons led to an increase in private kiln production, patronage and subsequently the quality of blue and white porcelain. \r\n",
