    "Description": "Sh\u00f4ki the Demon Queller is depicted standing with a sword. The legend of Sh\u00f4ki originated in China. Sh\u00f4ki was an aspiring scholar in China who committed suicide when he failed the examinations to become a government official. The emperor, when he realized the degree of Sh\u00f4ki's commitment to service, awarded him the title of doctor. Sh\u00f4ki then appeared to the emperor in a dream where he vowed to protect the empire from demons to show his gratitude. This is part of a set with Walters 51.1022.",
