    "Description": "The subject is taken from Ludovico Ariosto's 16th-century romantic epic \"Orlando furioso.\" The princess Angelica and the infantryman Medoro are depicted on their honeymoon, celebrating their love by carving each other's names into trees. Here, the two are amorously entwined while Medoro writes his beloved's name. Flying cupids with a torch allude to their burning love, while the little cupid below spells out their names. This subject was much favored by painters of the 18th century because of its pastoral and erotic nature.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 399, p. 511.",
