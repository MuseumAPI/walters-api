    "Description": "Decorative chatelaines were worn by men and women as pendants and multifunctional devices for carrying utensils like watches, signet seals, and sewing accessories. They were suspended from the waistband by means of the hook at the top, and the flexible, separate panels adjusted to the movements of the wearer. The watch and chatelaine are decorated with elaborate scrollwork and garlands over beautifully striated agate. The chatelaine is fitted with a watch key and a revolving rock crystal seal, neither of which were likely made at the same time as the chatelaine and watch.",
