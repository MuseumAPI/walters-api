    "Description": "This manuscript was created in Flanders ca. 1270-80. Originally a standard liturgical Psalter, it was converted in the fourteenth century for the use of an English owner, possibly a cleric, through the addition of a second litany focused on English saints and an Office of the Dead. The illuminations, composed of vignettes depicting labors of the months in the calendar and historiated initials within the psalms themselves, belong to the first phase of production and are characteristic of Psalter iconography from the Bruges-Ghent region during this period.",
