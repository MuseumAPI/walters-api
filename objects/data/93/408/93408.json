    "Description": "This tureen-shaped urn is carved of nephrite, a green jade much favored by the Faberg\u00e9 firm. Enormous nephrite boulders had been discovered along the Onot River in eastern Siberia in 1851. A pair of loving doves in pav\u00e9-set diamonds and a cupid's bow and arrows in green and red gold--both motifs associated with the French 18th-century master Fran\u00e7ois Boucher--are mounted on the urn's cover. Suspended from alternating diamonds and rubies are yellow gold garlands with red gold ties. Rows of diamonds, interspersed at intervals with rubies, line the rim of the urn. This piece is of exceptional quality and may, in fact, be an imperial commission.",
