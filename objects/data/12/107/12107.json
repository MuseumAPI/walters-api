    "Description": "This wine jar of globular shape is painted with underglaze blue symbols of immortality. The trunk of a peach tree is twisted into the character Shou, meaning \"longevity'. Peach threes are emblems of marriage and more appropriately for immortality.. A peach tree of the gods was believed to blossom every 3,000 years to yield the fruits of eternal life, which ripened for another 3,000 years. The peach fruit was also believed to give the Taoist Immortals their immortality; additionally the Taoist god of longevity is often depicted emerging from a peach. Sprouting from the roots of the peach three is the sacred fungus lingzhi, another symbol of longevity. \r\n\r\nUnder the reign of a devout Taoist Jiajing 91522-66), blue and white porcelain became decorated heavily with Taoist motifs. Cobalt used to paint these decorations is an intense blue with rich violet made by mixing imported cobalt with a bright domestic kind called Buddha Head Blue. Blue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
