    "Description": "In this painting, showing the outcome of a duel after a costume ball, G\u00e9r\u00f4me replicates, with slight variations, a composition he had executed for the Duc d'Aumale in 1857.  It is dawn on a wintry day in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, and Pierrot succumbs in the arms of the Duc de Guise.  A Venetian doge examines Pierrot's wound while Domino clasps his head in despair.  To the right, the victorious American Indian departs, accompanied by Harlequin.",
