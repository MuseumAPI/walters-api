    "Description": "This is a Sihing-type image (or \"lion\") with characteristic short mantle, hand on the knee, and legs in \"vajrasana.\" The pedestal is of Sinhalese type, spreading outward from the legs to a vertical edge. Although many of the qualities (such as the undulant line at the waist) are not very different from those seen on images made in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, there is a stiffness in the modeling of the lips that sets the sculpture apart.",
