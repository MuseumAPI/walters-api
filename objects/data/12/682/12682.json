    "Description": "This prayer scroll was written in the nineteenth century to protect its owner, W\u00e4ld\u00e4 Giyorgis. The front of the scroll contains prayers against evil which invoke the help of the Archangel Phanuel, while the back contains prayers requesting things as diverse as luck in love, help with headaches, and the protection of domestic animals. Scrolls such as these would have been worn as protective devices, and were made the length of the owner in order to protect them from head to foot. With a length of 151 cm, it can be inferred that Walda Giyorgis stood just under 5 feet tall.",
