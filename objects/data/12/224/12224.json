    "Description": "Palissy is known as a potter for such oval dishes transformed into tiny ponds, complete with vegetation, fish, and creatures from the water's edge. To make his ceramic ponds as lifelike as possible, he made molds from actual shells, frogs, lizards, fish, and other creatures to create life-like models. He developed new techniques for more subtle tones and life-like coloring. The ingenuity of these imitations of nature was greatly appreciated in court circles; one of his patrons was the French queen, Catherine de Medici. \r\n\r\nIn his desire to find better clays for pottery and invent more vibrant glazes, he began digging in the earth, which led him to the study of nature's \"secrets\" concerning minerals, the flow of water, and fossils, about which he made important discoveries.",
