    "Description": "Dated March 8, 1815, Leslie's holograph written in the form of an IOU gently mocks the high-flown sentiments of this genre and draws on a long history of satirical depictions of impoverished poets. This holograph is likely to have come into the Walters' collection from that of another Baltimore collector, Robert Gilmor. Gilmor published a catalogue of his collection that he described as \"for the use of my friends, that they might know what autographs I had, & consequently what I had not, & which when in their honor to supply would be acceptable.\"",
