She died very young, but had two sons, one of whom, Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), was the \"Young Pretender.\" The subject's royal status is indicated by the crown at her right. She wears a large stomacher in the form of a bouquet of jeweled and enameled flowers. A single jewel is mounted above her forehead and looped over her shoulder is a magnificent rope of pearls.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 389, pp. 504-505.",
