    "Description": "Medusa, the only mortal among the three terrifying winged Gorgon sisters, could turn humans into stone. In early Greece, she was usually depicted with wings on her head, her face surrounded by snakes, with long fangs, and her tongue sticking out, all of which suggests her monstrous character. In later times, her features softened, and she was portrayed as a calm, beautiful woman. Medusa heads, intended to avert evil, were used as decorative elements on a large variety of items, such as vessels, statues, armor, and sarcophagi.",
