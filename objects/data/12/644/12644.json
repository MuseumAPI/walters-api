    "Description": "Angela Maria Lercari was born in Genoa in 1684 and married Marquis Anton Filippo Lombardi in 1704. The marchioness wears a splendid costume that enhances her beauty and marks her social status. Her \"mantua\" (a one-piece open robe) is made of a sky-blue silk damask brocaded in silver and trimmed in the finest lace. The so-called \"bizarre\" pattern of the damask, produced in France and Italy, was highly fashionable around 1700.\r\n\r\nThe Latin inscription along the edges, possibly a later addition, cites her birth date, family relations, and Christian virtues. The attention to detail is remarkable but has not led to the identification of the artist. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 388, pp. 502-504.",
