    "Description": "This Biblical scene depicts the Holy Family resting near a river along their route on the Flight into Egypt. The branches of a palm tree visible at the left edge are the only indication of the lands through which the family passed. Indeed the fantasy architecture and even the river and waterfall to the rear indicate that the artist had no real idea about the reality of the dry landscape of Gaza and Egypt, but then neither did the contemporary viewers. \r\n\r\nThe quick, painterly brushstrokes are characteristic of the artist Giuseppe Zais (1709-1784). The colors are very fresh, although the paint surface is slightly damaged.  Previously the painting was attributed to Maro Ricci (1676-1730). For more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue \"Italian Paintings in the Walters Art Gallery,\" no. 454, p. 566.",
