    "Description": "James G. Harwood was regarded as a promising young Baltimore artist when he died mysteriously of gun-shot wounds at the age of 28. Little is known of his career other than that he had studied for a year in New York with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and had also enrolled for two years at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris, a popular destination for Americans training in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this scene, Harwood has portrayed the Maryland Fifth Regiment marching up Charles Street in Baltimore on a rainy day. Two dates have been suggested for this work, the Defenders' Day celebration in September 1889 or the celebration of the ending of the Spanish-American War on September 7, 1898. On both occasions, it rained.",
