    "Description": "This triptych, or three-paneled altarpiece, once contained relics in the circular holes of the central section. Around the Madonna and Child in the places of honor are Saints Aurea and John the Baptist. On the wings, Gabriel announces the incarnation of Christ with the words written in Latin on his scroll which translate as, \"the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Almighty shall overshadow thee,\" from the mass sung on the Feast of the Annunciation. The unidentified coats of arms are probably those of the donors.  The delicacy of this work reveals Vanni's debt to Simone Martini.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this reliquary, please see Zeri catalogue number 26, pp. 44-46.\r\n",
