    "Description": "This biblical scene shows the feast given by Joseph in honor of his brothers during their visit to Egypt (Genesis 43). The bothers, who are Isrealites, do not know that Joseph, their \"Egyptian\" host, is actually their brother. Joseph is pictured on the right, seated by himself, since an Egyptian was not permitted to eat with a Isrealite.\r\n\tThis painting is derived from a design by Bronzino for a tapestry dated 1549. Originally intended for the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, the tapestry is currently in the Palazzo Quirinale in Rome. Morandini was called \"il Poppi\" after his birthplace, a village near Florence. He was a pupil of Giorgi Vasari and collaborated with his master in the decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio around 1570.\r\n",
