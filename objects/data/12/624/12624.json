    "Description": "The combination of wide eyes and narrow mouth gives this image a rather severe expression.  Though it is now obscured with lacquer and gilding, the crown is of standard Ayutthaya type, with raised-line ornament.  The typical Ayutthaya crowned Buddha, with such features as the headdress of tiered rings, appears to have become established at the end of the 15th century or during the course of the 16th; after that, the sculptors varied little but the details of the decoration of the crown.  The headdress of tiered rings has forerunners in the Hindu images of Sukhothai.",
