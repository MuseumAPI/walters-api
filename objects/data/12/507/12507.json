    "Description": "This statue is characteristic of a portrait tradition of Alexander that was established during his life. The powerfully muscular physique with irregularly bulging contours suggests that the figure was created by Alexandrian craftsmen. The wax model for the figure was assembled from elements cast in different molds, resulting in the unusual proportions of the limbs.",
