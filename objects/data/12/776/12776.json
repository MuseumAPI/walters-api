    "Description": "This appealing portrait of a youth may have been commissioned by a loving parent. The focus is on the soft, rounded contours of the boy's face. De Bray placed him so that the light strikes his right cheek, giving more depth to his face than would lighting from the front. A subtle embellishment is provided by the decorative braid on the jacket--its texture catches the light, creating innumerable glistening, tiny beads.",
