The sitter's cap is the type a nobleman would don at home when not wearing his wig.\r\n\r\nGhislandi, the greatest Lombard portraitist of his age, was a lay brother of the Order of the Minims. Fra Galgario was his nickname, referring to the monastery of Galgario in the city of Bergamo with which he was associated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 457, pp. 569-570.",
