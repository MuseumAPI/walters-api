Verse markers in the shape of trefoils indicate the end of each verse, and the letter ha' in the form of a teardrop and discs with rosettes indicate groups of five and ten verses. The illuminated finispiece with colophon (fol. 133b) states that it is the end of volume 9 of the Qur'an (al-juz' al-tasi' min al-rab'ah) and offers a prayer for the Prophet Muhammad and his family.
