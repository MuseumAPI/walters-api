    "Description": "Two Fu-Lions within a landscape are painted in underglaze cobalt blue on this pear shaped bottle vase. The pair of lions play beneath the shade of a pine tree, which reaches up the neck of the vessel where the moon is visible from its branches. The rocks behind the tree sprout prunus and bamboo, combining with the pine to complete a trio of winter plants symbolizing longevity. A couple of bats, emblems of happiness, fly together on the other side of the vase. Great control of brush strokes appear in the highly articulated textures of the scene and its creatures. A wash of cobalt blue, applied in brushy stroked similarly to paint upon paper, sets the moon forward from a dark night sky. Faint crackle appears in the glaze allover.  \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain of the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
