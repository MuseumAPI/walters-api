    "Description": "Bacchus is seen with a flowing drapery and his club, looking back over his shoulder. The plaque was squared for inlay, and has been broken at the left side and bottom.\r\n\r\nTwo plaques with similar figures, carved in the same rough technique, with male figures looking back over their shoulders, are in Berlin. They apparently come from the same or a similar object, and have a band of molding at the base.",
