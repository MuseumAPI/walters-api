The appliqu\u00e9, originally a circular medallion but now damaged at the sides, ornamented the lower end of a fulcrum. The undecorated back surface has a central depression from which the once circular contour was compass drawn. The medallion would have been glued to the fulcrum, its back surface heavily scored for proper adhesion.",
