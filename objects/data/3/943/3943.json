    "Description": "The earliest watches were small, portable versions of drum-shaped table clocks.  This one has a sundial, which was far more accurate and could be used to reset the clock.  The 24-hour dial is marked in Roman numerals on the outer band and in Arabic numerals on the inner one.  The animals leaping through the foliage design were cast in relief and then chased, marking this watch as an object of luxury.",
