    "Description": "Byzantine craftsmen revived the Hellenistic tradition of incorporating multicolored gemstones in jewelry, which was not common during the Roman imperial period. The ten sections of this openwork diadem were each adorned with a central gem and pearls, now missing. The diadem was sewn onto a headband of leather or cloth with holes so wearers could adjust the size. Similar pieces were also worn as neckbands. This example would most likely have been worn by members of the imperial family as its amethysts evoke the imperial color purple.",
