    "Description": "This squat lekythos depicts Eutychia, Eunomia, and Paidia. On the left Eutychia stands frontally, looking right. She holds a chest on her left forearm at waist level; her right hand hangs down by her side holding a necklace. She wears a girded peplos, diadem, necklace, earring, and bracelets. Next is Eunomia who walks solemnly to the right, holding a necklace between her outstretched hands. She wears a girded peplos, necklace, bracelets, earring, diadem and a decorated band which holds her hair in place. On the right Paidia stands turned partially to the left, holding a chest. She wears a girded peplos, necklace, earring, and bracelets; her hair is tied in back. A diphros with a thick, patterned cushion stands beside her.\r\n\r\nThe personifications on this vase, from left to right are to be understood as Good Luck, Good Order, and Games and Play. They are depicted as normal Athenian women and do nothing which might associate their actions with the literal meanings of their names.",
