    "Description": "The tondo of the kylix shows a youthful warrior with long curly hair. He is nude except for his Attic helmet and holds a spear and a large round shield decorated with a horse, of which only the back is visible. He seems to be running from an enemy on the left: his head, shield, and spear are turned backwards (left), while he is fleeing in the opposite direction. The artist skillfully explores the various angles of the twisted body and fits it nicely into the circular shape of the tondo. The inscription in red translates to: \"the boy is beautiful.\"",
