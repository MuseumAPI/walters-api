    "Description": "This globular bottle vase is painted with underglaze cobalt blue designs on white porcelain. Archaic dragons that camouflage seamlessly with the floral scrolls surrounding them hold the flowers in their mouths to frame the character \"shou\", meaning longevity. Ruyi heads, trefoil motifs named for their resemblance to the head of the curved ruyi scepter carried by certain Buddhist deities, appear beneath a geometric keyfret on the shoulders. The neck is painted with pairs of confronting dragons while more Ruyi heads appear beneath the broad everted lip, decorated with a circle of four pairs of small dragons. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n",
