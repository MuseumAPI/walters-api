    "Description": "Zeus in the guise of an eagle is about to carry off Ganymede to Mount Olympus to be cupbearer to the gods. The boy, shown falling to his knees and raising his hand in alarm, wears a Phrygian cap, trousers, and cloak. He holds a \"pedum,\" or shepherd's staff, but has dropped his shield, visible at the lower right.\r\n\r\nThe upper left corner and part of the bottom are missing, and the plaque is cracked along the lower left side. The relief probably decorated a cosmetic or jewelry box, its four edges originally sliding under and retained by the framing panels of the box.\r\n\r\nThe subject was very popular in ivory and other mateirals in Roman art. Typologically, tihs plaque is related to Walters 71.593.",
