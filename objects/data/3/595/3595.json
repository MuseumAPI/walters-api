    "Description": "This crab is so life-like that one would think it was cast from life; however, evidence of tool marks made in the original model raise the possibility that this is essentially an artistic interpretation. However, individual parts may have been cast indirectly from dead specimens and then worked up; the use of a punch tool on the shells is very clear.\r\n\t\r\nLittle is known about this artist except that he cast his signature on the underside. He is assumed to have worked at about the same time as Seimin. Perhaps he set out to demonstrate his virtuosity by competing with life casting.\r\n",
