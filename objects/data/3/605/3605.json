    "Description": "The ancient Greek romance of Clariclea, a princess of Ethiopia who was miraculously born white to black parents (the queen and king of Ethiopia) who as a new-born was left out to die but surviived to lead a life of adventure in Egypt and Greece, here returns to Ethiopia and is recognized by/ reconciled with her parents. The story, virtually unknown today, was popular in France in the 1600s but not as a story about Africa but about a princess with pluck. To facilitate the fashionable owner of such a precious mirror (back) identifying with Chariclea, her parents are depicted as white.\r\n\r\nHenri Toutin developed a new technique that permitted a white gound instead of the black used previously. It revolutionized the pictorial effects of painted enamel.",
