    "Description": "This brush washer was carved in the round, most likely with wooden tools or sandstone (drills, polishers) coated with mineral paste to break away the hard jade. It is in the shape of a peony, known as the \"queen of flowers\", and as a sign of wealth and distinction.  White peopnies symbolize young girls who are wise and beautiful.  The brush washer was used to clean paintbrushes and would have been placed on a desk with other writing instruments.",
