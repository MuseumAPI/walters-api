    "Description": "According to Catholic tradition, Mary Magdalene was a beautiful woman who had led a sinful life. Upon meeting Christ, she repented of her former ways. This painting characteristically depicts Mary Magdalene as a young woman with long blond hair, bared chest, and pale skin. Her eyes are turned sorrowfully towards God, and she is represented with a cross and a skull. Crespi has imitated the famous depictions of the same subject by another great Bolognese painter Guido Reni (Walters 37.2631). \r\n\r\nExquisitely executed, the painting's small size indicates that it was a private devotional image for prayer and meditation.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 440, pp. 551-552.",
