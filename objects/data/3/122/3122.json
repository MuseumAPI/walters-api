    "Description": "This is the only identified religious painting by Peter Gertner, who was best known as a portrait artist.  Here he uses the skills he honed as a portraitist to introduce distinctive details of costumes, facial expressions, and gestures for both the historical and contemporary figures gathered beneath the Cross.  The crowd includes men of many origins: Jewish, Turkish, German, and African.  This diversity would both intrigue the viewer and remind him or her of the universal message of the scene.\r\n\r\nGertner's monogram consists of a spade with his initials. It is a play on his name, a variation on \"gardener\" in German.\r\n",
