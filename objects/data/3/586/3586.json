    "Description": "This vase, a pair with WAM 48.861, shows scenes of sacrifice to Pomona and Flora (the goddesses of fruits and flowers) probably designed by Lady Elizabeth Templeton and modelled by William Hackwood. Hackwood was first taken on at the Wedgwood Etruria factory in 1769, and worked for the firm for 63 years. He was mainly employed in adapting, re-modelling and finishing busts and bas reliefs, such as the ones that appear on these vases. Jasperware, which was inspired by Roman cameo glass, was a technique invented by Wedgwood which was perfected in 1775.",
