    "Description": "In this scene, a cook wearing a vermilion apron is chopping a large cabbage. Commonplace vegetables are strewn in front of her, including turnips, leeks, celery roots, carrots, and lettuce. The model has been identified as the artist's wife, Constance F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Gaudon, and the location as the family's small tavern. Light from a window at the right penetrates the scene to reveal details in the background including the hanging basket and the shelf with a row of candlesticks, a coffee mill, and a lantern. Placed on the stove is a large, glimmering copper pot.\r\n\r\nL\u00e9on Bonvin was born in Vaugirard, just outside Paris in 1834. Despite displaying great talent in the medium of watercolor he was largely unrecognized by his contemporaries. In 1866 he hanged himself at the age of 32, apparently due to financial difficulties. Working at his family's bar or \"cabaret,\" he sketched and painted watercolors only in his spare moments, yet in the seven year period between 1859 and his death he created numerous exquisite still lifes of flowers and fruits, and subtle landscapes capturing fleeting atmospheric effects. There is evidence that, despite his rural home, Bonvin did have knowledge of the art world in Paris. His half-brother was the better known artist, Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin. In addition Bonvin's still lifes show the influence of Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin (1699-1779), whose work was undergoing a revival in the 1850s and 60s.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century an appreciation of Bonvin's work was confined to a small circle of connoisseurs and collectors, most prominent among them William T. Walters, father of Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum. For much of the 19th century William displayed and stored his watercolors in a deluxe leather-bound album with a specially commissioned frontispiece and tailpiece by the renowned flower painter of the Lyon school, Jean-Marie Reignier (see WAM 37.1501 and 37. 1531). William's collection of Bonvin's work was acquired between 1862 and 1891, and eventually comprised 56 watercolors and one, rare oil; today, this is the largest collection of Bonvin's work in existence. \r\n",
