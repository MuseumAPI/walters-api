    "Description": "Bearing the monogram of Leonard Limosin on the back, this dish is one of the master's finest works. Gathered at the banquet table are Jupiter with his thunderbolt and Ganymede, Jupiter's cupbearer, pouring water into a basin, Venus and Hercules (seen from the back), and Cupid standing at Psyche's knee. Above the gathering hover the Horae, winged goddesses associated with the seasons and marriages of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe composition ultimately derives from Raphael's famous fresco \"Wedding Feast of Cupid and Psyche\" (1518-19) in the Villa Farnesina, Rome, via a contemporary engraving.  While there are many renderings of this subject in painted enamel, in no other case is the execution so nuanced or the components so deftly reorganized to accommodate the shape of the ware.",
