    "Description": "Most archaic Greek gems were carved in the form of a scarab beetle. The type is ultimately of Egyptian origin and is thought to have passed to the Greeks via the Phoenicians probably on the island of Cyprus, which served as a crossroads for the eastern Mediterranean. The intaglio design and careful articulation of the beetle suggest a date in the early 6th century.\r\n\r\nThe hollow, round hoop, narrows to pass through the scarab; the shoulders are spirally wound with wire. The parts of the scarab's back are carefully articulated. The intaglio design depicts a centaur facing right with a raised right arm holding a club (?). To his right, one complete lion with its head turned back, and the foreparts of a second lion above the first; with a line border.",
