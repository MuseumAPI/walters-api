    "Description": "The Flemish painter Jan Frans van Bloemen was one of many northern artists who settled in Rome and specialized in landscape painting. The Roman \"campagna\" was the countryside around Rome, and, in the background of this scene, the Sabine hills can be seen. Figures talk in the foreground; further back, sheep graze. Evoking the mood of pastoral poetry of antiquity, the scenery is represented as having an air of unchanging tranquility and is characteristic of the classical landscapes so popular during the 17th century.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 396, p. 509.",
