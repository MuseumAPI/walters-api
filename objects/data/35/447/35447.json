    "Description": "The chubby little boy with a baby on his back is too strong to be a real toddler. These infants must be putti, the playful, often winged spirits in the shape of little naked babies and children that were popular throughout the baroque age as expressions of the artists' inventiveness and wit.\r\n\r\nKern specialized in small-scale sculptures produced in a variety of materials, although it is not clear whether he supervised the production of bronze versions of his compositions.  These were collected by aristocratic patrons, and, in 1648, Kern was appointed as court sculptor to Friedrich Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, elector of Brandenburg.\r\n",
