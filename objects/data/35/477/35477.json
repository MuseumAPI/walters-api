    "Description": "The identity of this richly dressed lady is unknown. The composition of the portrait, including the lady's faithful lap dog-probably a beloved pet but also a symbol of the importance of a wife's being faithful to her husband-is typical of Florentine conventions of the 16th century.\r\n\r\nThe inscription in the upper right corner of the painting translates as: \"By yourself you see her appearance; from her appearance you may infer her character.\" This saying is derived from a common Renaissance belief that an individual's soul is reflected in his or her physical appearance.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 226, pp. 342-343.",
