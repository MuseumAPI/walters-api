    "Description": "The half-length portrait represents the princess turned to the right, her face in three-quarters view. Her hair is cut with short locks at the sides, and with a slight bang over the forehead. She wears a decollet\u00e9 blue and white dress trimmed with deep, pointed white lace, a necklace of pearls, as well as a rope of pearls fastened to her collar on either side. A thin line of gold frames the portrait, which is probably based on a contemporary painting or an engraving after a painting.\r\n\r\nBeatrice de Cusance, daughter of Claude de Beauvoir, married in 1635 the wealthy Eug\u00e8ne L\u00e9opold d'Oiselet, Prince of Cantecroix.",
