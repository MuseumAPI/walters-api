    "Description": "The capital consists of two tiers of acanthus leaves forming a calyx out of which spring the larger leaves and tendrils that constitute the upper part of the capital. The hollow of the bone, running vertically through the capital, allowed it to be doweled to a post. The capital probably functioned as a finial on a couch or chair. The ends of many of the leaves and tendrils are broken. The upper surface is smoothly finished.",
