    "Description": "Like many other Dutch landscape artists, Ruysdael celebrated the new nation's countryside, coastal scenes, and urban profiles in his landscape views. However, they are more impressions of the countryside than exact \"snapshots.\"\r\n\r\nBy presenting the river at an angle that is both a diagonal (on the surface of the picture) and oblique (receding back into space), Ruysdael invites us to follow it into the landscape. Clouds and clumps of trees accentuate these patterns. He was a pioneer of the \"tonal\" landscape, a Dutch innovation in which a restricted color scheme evokes the pale luminosity of the overcast Dutch skies.\r\n",
