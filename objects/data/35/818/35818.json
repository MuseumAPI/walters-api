With her regular features that resemble an ancient marble statue, she represents an ideal type rather than a specific woman. Her curling hair, in particular, demonstrates Rocca's typically fluid and graceful handling of the brush.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 398, pp. 510-511.",
