    "Description": "This wall painting fragment has a block border at the left. The piece has been repaired and repainted, and is from a tomb at Western Thebes. This man (with red flesh) was the last in a row of offering bearers. Facing right, he wears a kilt extending to the ankles that was perhaps worn under a white short-sleeved garment. He has a black coiffure covering the ears. He carries a table with a basket of red fruit (possibly pomegranates) from which flowers hang.",
