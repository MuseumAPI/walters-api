    "Description": "Corot first visited the Normandy coast in the early 1820s and often returned thereafter. Since he did not visit the coast in 1871, this must represent a memory of an earlier stay based on studies or simply on his recollections. He concentrates on the rustic cottages and picturesque fisher-folk of the region, ignoring all signs of tourism.",
