    "Description": "This footed cup is divided into six parts, segmented by a scalloped lip and further by the double lined borders painted vertically down the cup's body. Along both the inner and outer rim is a foliated band of simple flowers and leaves forming six arches that correspond with the shape of the lip. Below the floral band, pomegranate and peony sprays alternate from one framed section to next. Beneath each floral decoration is the sacred fungus lingzhi, believed to ensure long life and a symbol for immortality. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
