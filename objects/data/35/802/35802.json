    "Description": "Eight gods are seated at table, the background is draped with a looped curtain; the banquet takes place in a hall rather than the summit of Mount Olympus. Buildings are seen through the window on the left. Cupid lifts the front of the tablecloth (compare with Walters 44.286), disclosing the wooden support of the table. An ewer and basin also occupy the foreground. \r\n\r\nOn the reverse in a central medallion of twisted cable framework is the standing figure of Jupiter with an eagle at his feet. Around this is a frame surmounted by a putto mask, while below Jupiter is a tablet with the date: 1567. Scrollwork in gold fills out the area and the rim is decorated with interlacing ribbon in white.",
