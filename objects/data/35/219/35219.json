    "Description": "This type of vase, known as an \"alabastron,\" was suspended from a cord that passed through a tiny ring handle under the rim. Typically, the contents of such vases were precious oils, often perfumed. The goddess Artemis is depicted as \"Mistress of Beasts,\" a winged deity of Eastern origins who displays her power by grasping wild animals, here swans, in each hand. The red and black patterning and the use of rosettes are characteristic of Corinthian ware.",
