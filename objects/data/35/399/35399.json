    "Description": "In 1224, as St. Francis (1181-1226) and a follower were in the mountains meditating on Christ's suffering, Francis had a vision of a seraph (a six-winged angel) crucified like Christ. Immediately, there appeared on Francis's body the stigmata, visible marks of the wounds of the crucified Christ that he carried to his grave. The religious orders founded by St. Francis were influential in the Southern Netherlands and enjoyed the support of the archdukes.\r\n\r\nBril trained as a landscapist in Antwerp but had a successful career in Rome. The composition and deep brownish-green tones suggest his manner around 1620, but the execution lacks his clarity, and the natural detail in the lower left is more prominent than in his accepted works. This is the work of a talented pupil or imitator.\r\n",
