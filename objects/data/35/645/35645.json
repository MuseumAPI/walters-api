    "Description": "The Holy Kinship is a celebration of Christ's human family, as derived from the Bible and popular legend. The subject is often presented as a family tree.\r\n \r\nIn the center are Jesus' foster father Joseph, his mother Mary, and her parents, Sts. Anne and Zacharius. From St. Anne descend the Virgin and Child as well as Mary's two half-sisters. John the Baptist, Jesus' cousin, shares the left wing with four more cousins: Sts. James the Less, Judas, Thaddeus, and Simon, all apostles, and Josiah the Just, a judge and early convert. On the right, Sts. John the Evangelist and James the Great are joined by St. Servatius a 4th-century bishop whose legend claims him as kin to Jesus. The saint died in the Netherlands and was treated there with special honor.",
