    "Description": "Richards was a Philadelphia artist who was known for his meticulously faithful rendering of nature inspired by the writings of the influential critic John Ruskin. Ruskin's influence can be seen on Richards' work from 1858. This drawing has been attributed to Richards on the grounds of its resemblance to another work also in the Walters Art Museum which was likely acquired in the same period (WAM 37.1966).",
