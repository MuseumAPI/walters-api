    "Description": "This image of John the Evangelist, clothed in draped robes and sandals, recalls the tradition of classical author portraits. He sits on a folding chair and is actively writing in response to the inspiration he is receiving from his symbol, the eagle. Unlike his fellow Evangelists in this manuscript, John writes on an unfurled scroll that is draped across his lap.",
