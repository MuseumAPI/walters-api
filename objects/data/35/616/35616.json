    "Description": "The Kamigamo Shrine is the oldest Shinto shrine in the former Japanese capital of Kyoto. It is dedicated to the deity Kamo-wake-ikazuchi, who appeared miraculously to a daughter of the ruling clan while she was performing a purification ritual in the Kamo River. The deity was initially enshrined at the top of Mount Ko, seen in the distance, but was transferred to this 7th-century building during the Heian period.\r\n\r\nThe mate to this screen, also in the Walters' collection (35.148), depicts the Byodo-in, a famous Buddhist temple in the nearby town of Uji.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
