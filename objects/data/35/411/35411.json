    "Description": "The Virgin is carved from a thin curved piece of ivory, backed with a fill of hardwood (chestnut (?)) to stabilize the figure. The tall Virgin wears a mantle that falls straight from her shoulders, and offers a flower to the Child, whom she holds with her right hand.\r\n\r\nThe crown, which was of carved ivory, is missing, and the head is crosshatched to receive it. There are traces of gilding in the hair and a gilt line across the raised base. The Child's head has been broken and repaired with the original piece.",
