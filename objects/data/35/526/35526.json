    "Description": "Conca represents the different character of the four seasons through one of the most favored artistic motifs of the 18th century, the \"putto\" (embodying the spirit of a little child). The playful, tender, and fleshy figures convey a light mood. As allegorical personifications here, they act out seasons through typical activities. Seated at the fire of a brazier, Winter wraps himself up against the cold (Walters 37.1791); Spring holds a wreath of flowers (Walters 37.1724); Summer shades his head with a leaf against the heat while cooling his foot in a stream; and Autumn, like a little Bacchus (the ancient god of wine), holds grapes, representing the harvest (Walters 37.1792). The charming series was surely intended to decorate a small room, perhaps a dressing room.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this series, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 433, pp. 545-546.",
