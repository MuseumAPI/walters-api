    "Description": "This bottle shaped vase, categorized as a garlic-headed vase (suantou ping), is painted with outline and wash underglaze cobalt blue on white porcelain. Four imperial dragons ascend and descend in pursuit of flaming pearls hidden among a thick spray of peony and prunus (cherry or plum) blossoms. Around the shoulder is a string of Ruyi heads, named for their resemblance to the head of the curved ruyi scepter carried by certain Buddhist deities. These heart shaped motifs are an emblem of monastic authority in Buddhism. The neck is covered with lotus flowers and leaves. The bulbed mouth is painted with hanging tassels beneath a register of repeated plantain leaves. A narrow band on the neck is inscribed with the six character mark of the reign of Wanli (1573-1619). The vase has a low round body, heavily sloped shoulders and tall neck which transitions smoothly into the garlic-shaped bulb. A circular rimmed mouth opens at the top of the bulged neck. It may have been used as a vessel for hot water. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, later replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. \r\n\r\nThe kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain. During the reign of Wanli (1573-1619) corrupt exploitation of the Jingdezhen kilns for economic reasons led to an increase in private kiln production, patronage and subsequently the quality of blue and white porcelain. \r\n\r\n",
