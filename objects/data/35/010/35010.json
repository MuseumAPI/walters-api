    "Description": "A group of stem cups gifted to the museum in 1983 by Mrs. P. R. Lyne represent a series of porcelains for use on a Buddhist altar. Three of the cups date to the reign of Daoguang (1821-1850) and resemble the cups of previous Qing emperor Qianlong (1735-1795). An identical cup is part of the original collection of William T. and Henry Walters [WALTERS 49.147]. \r\n\r\nPainted in underglaze cobalt blue are Tibetan letters mounted above lotus blossoms and surrounded by foliated patterns that coil around each character. The underside of the cup that proceeds the elevated foot is painted with stylized lotus petals. Beaded tassels dangle down the sides of the everted foot. A protruding ring high on the foot is decorated with a white band with floral scrolls. The Buddhist symbolism and imagery suggest the use of these cups in ceremony and as altar items. \r\n\r\nThe Daoguang reign (1821-51) revived blue and white porcelain following a marked lack during the preceding Jiaqing reign (1796-1820). During this time, foreign influences became more prominent and European missionaries and merchants dictated much of the blue and white porcelain production. Designs and styles of the Ming dynasty and the Kangxi reign were emulated and copied. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
