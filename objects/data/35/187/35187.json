    "Description": "The scenes of the Flagellation and Resurrection each contain three figures carefully spaced in unusually rhythmic compositions. The figure of Christ in the Resurrection merely stepping on the tomb rather than out of it is unusual. The scenes are placed beneath arcades of three trefoil arches with large crockets.\r\n\r\nThe cross staff of Christ is broken. The hinges are fragmentary, and there is a chip out of the lower right corner.",
