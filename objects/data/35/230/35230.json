    "Description": "Thesmar began his career designing textiles but was later employed as an enameler. Beginning in about 1890, Thesmar began to work in \"plique-\u00e0-jour,\" or openwork, enamel. By 1912, the year of his death, Thesmar was acclaimed as France's finest enameler. Because of their extreme fragility, few of his works survive.",
