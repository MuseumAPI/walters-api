    "Description": "Underglaze cobalt blue is painted in floral patterns uniformly on this white porcelain bottle vase. The pear shaped body rests on a narrow raised foot rim and has a slim straight neck and sloped shoulders. Peony and lotus blossoms are integrated with spiraling spiked leaves that sprawl over the entirety of the vase. An outline and wash application of paint provides varied shades of blue that accentuate the petals and leaves of the floral decoration. The foot and mouth are painted with double rings in blue. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n",
