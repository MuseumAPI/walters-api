    "Description": "Since Kampei was with his beloved Okaru at the time of his master Hangan's suicide, he feels too disgraced to join the other warriors in their pursuit of vengeance. He has therefore gone off by himself into the countryside. While Kampei is seated with his rifle under a pine during a rainstorm, one of the warriors, Yagoro, happens to come by carrying a lantern. \"If I could find some way of meeting Yuranosuke [the leader of the warriors] and persuading him to let me add my seal to those of the others in the league,\" says Kampei, \"my honor would be restored through this and all lives to come.\"",
