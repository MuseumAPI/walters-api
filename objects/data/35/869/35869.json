    "Description": "Salviati & Company produced faithful copies of ancient vessels, but the firm was also known for original fanciful designs. New creations, such as this ewer, combined the styles and techniques of ancient Egypt with forms associated with Renaissance Venice. In ancient Egypt, vessels were formed by heating powdered glass in a furnace around a clay core. Once the glass had melted around the core, glassmakers trailed threads of molten glass around the vessel and combed the trails with a pointed tool to create patterns. The ewer combines the ancient trailing and combing techniques with the later technique of glass blowing to produce an entirely new effect.",
