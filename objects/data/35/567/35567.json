    "Description": "Gilded metal objects were long believed to have been made by Muslim craftsmen working in Venice during the Renaissance. It now seems more likely that they were made in Islamic lands for export to Europe. Muslim artisans often decorated their export wares with designs resembling European coats of arms, as seen in the center of the large tray or salver, as well as with the geometric patterns, medallions, and foliage scrolls (known as arabesque designs) typical of Islamic art. The name of Mahmud ibn al-Kurdi appears on a number of such export wares.",
