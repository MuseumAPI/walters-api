The two men became close friends, sharing a common interest in sailing. The case of the watch, made of red gold, is decorated with Henry's initials in white and yellow gold. It would have been worn on a chain like the one threaded through Henry's waistcoat button-hole. In 1922, three years after Jones died, his widow, Sadie, married Henry.",
