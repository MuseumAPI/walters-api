Regarded as one of the most gifted jurists of his generation, Johnson served in the U.S. senate and as the American Ambassador to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe artist noted that the trees and house were in shadow and were \"cutting against the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThis sketch comes from the family album of L. Vernon Miller, which contains works that have passed down through the Miller family directly from the artist.\r\n",
