    "Description": "The celebration of the Divine Liturgy is one of the most important ceremonies in the Christian Church. This ladle is part of a silver service (with Walters 57.634, 57.635, 57.642, 57.644, 57.645, 57.649, 57.650, and 57.638) that is one of only four to survive from the first \"golden age\" of Byzantium (6th century).  \r\n  \r\nEach of the vessels in this service performed a sacred function in the liturgical service. Strainers and spoons were used to filter and stir the wine.\r\n\r\nThis silver service was found in Syria in 1910, in the village of Kurin. The Greek form of its name, Kaper Koraon, is inscribed on several pieces in the treasure, including a chalice, which reads: \"...treasure of the Church of St. Sergios of the village of Kaper Koraon.\" Almost all of the vessels record the names of donors who gave pieces from their private dinner services in fulfillment of a vow, to gain divine blessing, or in prayer for salvation.",
