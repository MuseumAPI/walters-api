    "Description": "This relief is in imitation of Josiah Wedgwood's famous jasperware, which in turn was inspired by ancient Roman cameo glass. Enoch Wood was the son of Aaron Wood, an apprentice to Thomas Wedgwood (1771-1805), the son of Josiah. Enoch is believed to have been an apprentice at Josiah Wedgwood's factory, Etruria, in the 1770s, the decade in which Wedgwood perfected the technique known as jasperware. The subject of this relief is not classical but rather takes its subject from the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It shows the deposition (lowering) of Christ from the cross. The composition is loosely based on a painting by Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640).",
