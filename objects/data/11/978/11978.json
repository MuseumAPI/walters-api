    "Description": "Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater, childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).\r\n\r\nWritten at the top of this drawing in pencil: \"Recollections\" and \"One of the Dogberry's of 1825 Balto\". Below the drawing in pencil with some corrections in ink is written, \"after crying the hour of ten, he slept soundly in his box-- until roused again.\"",
