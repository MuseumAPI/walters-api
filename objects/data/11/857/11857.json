    "Description": "The central figure in this busy and lively painting is Vajradhara, regarded as the Adibuddha or Primordial Buddha and the embodiment of \"'sunyata\" (emptiness or void). The concept appears for the first time in the text \"Kalachakratantra\" (which was probably composed in the 10th century), embodied as a monotheistic figure presiding over the five transcendental Buddhas. In both Nepal and Tibet he is a very important deity, and the well-known shrine of Svayambhunath in the Kathmandu Valley is dedicated to Vajradhara as Adibuddha. In reality he is self-born, self-existent, eternal, and without form, a concept that clearly reflects Vedantic theology.",
