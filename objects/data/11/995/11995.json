    "Description": "This devotional panel depicts the Virgin affectionately holding the naked Christ Child, who turns his head outwards. The emphasis on naturalistic modeling and the sweetness of expression were characteristics of Florentine Renaissance painting, as also found in the works of Filippo Lippi (1406\u201369). As in the \"Virgin and Child\" by that artist on display in this gallery, Roselli has depicted Mary with a star on her robe, symbolic of her status as Stella maris (Star of the Sea). The ornately tooled gold background reminds us that this is a symbolic representation of the divine.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Zeri catalogue number 57, p. 93.",
