    "Description": "Italian painters and sculptors, such as Rosso Fiorentino (his Madonna and Child hangs in this gallery), who were invited to the French royal court at Fontainebleau, profoundly influenced French artists with whom they worked. Leonard Limosin, the greatest French enamelist, used Rosso's composition of the goddess Ops (photograph), a personification of plentiful nature, who squeezes milk from her breasts to feed the beasts gathered at her feet. The strong profile and roundness of Ops's body are accentuated by the clear drawing and silvery tones of the design. Such circular plaques or medallions could be set into wall paneling or used for other decorative purposes.",
