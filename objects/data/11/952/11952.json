    "Description": "The stylistic origins of this object in the bronzes of Bangladesh are clear. If it was not made there, it is likely to have been made by a sculptor trained there, or under the auspices of immigrants from there; otherwise it would probably not have been made of brass, nor would it bear an incised \"Buddhist creed\" at the back. The image appears to have had a renewed life beginning in about the 16th century, when the base was made.",
