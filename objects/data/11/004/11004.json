    "Description": "Millet's image of a shepherdess knitting on the plain of Chailly was modeled after his daughter Louise and was one of his most critically successful works when shown at the 1864 Salon. This is one of four pastels versions after the painting (now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris). His dynamic use of pastels masterfully evokes the sense of light breaking through the clouds.",
