    "Description": "This panel with the Prophet Joel, a pair with Walters 46.40, was once part of a larger program of decoration at the cathedral in Soissons that was paid for by King Philippe August of France (r. 1180-1223). Both panels have been heavily restored, so it is possible that Joel also held a scroll like Habbakuk.\r\n\r\nThis window was probably placed below figures of the apostles, visually demonstrating the Christian belief that the New Testament relied on and superseded the foundation of the Old Testament.",
