    "Description": "According to tradition, St. Sebastian was a Roman commander who was martyred under Emperor Diocletian (284-305) for his faith in Christ. Soldiers tied him up, show him with arrows, and left him for dead. Two days later, however, he returned to the emperor's palace, only to be beaten to death.\r\n\r\nThe artist has set the scene in an engaging and idealized landscape. The city in the background is probably meant to represent ancient Rome, where the story took place. Sebastian was venerated, as he was believed to offer protection from plague.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 134, pp. 201-202.",
