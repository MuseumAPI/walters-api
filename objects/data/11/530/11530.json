    "Description": "Depicting Mary Magdalene, identified by the ointment jar she cared to the tomb to anoint Christ's dead body, was a way of introducing the image of a beautiful, sexually attractive woman while still being able to claim that the subject was religious.  \r\n\r\nThis dish on a low foot is painted in blue, yellow,ochre, brown, black and opaque white. It features a representation of a lady, on a dark blue ground, with head turned three-quarters right and with curling locks over both shoulders. She has brown eyes, wears a blue dress and holds a covered jar. The back is bluish-white with one yellow circle near the rim.\r\n\r\n",
