    "Description": "The very busy composition of this dish is typical of the best works from Andrea da Negroponte's workshop. Apollo, the sun god, was also the god of art and learning. Here, he plays the viol, and two flying \"genii\" hold a laurel wreath over his head to show him victorious. This alludes to Apollo's musical contest with the satyr Marsyas, seated on the right, who played the flute. Having been judged the loser of the competition by the gods, he was flayed alive by Apollo. That gruesome story was interpreted as symbolic of the triumph of virtue.",
