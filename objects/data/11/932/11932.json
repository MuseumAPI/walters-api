    "Description": "Christ and the eleven apostles -Judas having departed- are seated along one side and at the ends of a wooden table covered with a cloth. In the foreground there are a wine-pot and a salver on edge. Behind the group the wall is pierced with a bull's-eye window and there are square windows on the side walls. \r\n\r\nThis Last Supper should more properly be called the Giving of the New Commandment, as it copies a woodcut executed by Albrecht D\u00fcrer in 1523 (B. VII, 53) under the influence of two publications of Martin Luther. These are \"The Sermon of the New Testament, that is on Holy Mass,\" (1520) and the \"Formula of the Mass,\" (1523). The moment referred to is when, after Judas had left, Christ gave to the eleven apostles the new commandment: \"...that you love one another as I loved you,\" (John 15:12). D\u00fcrer's woodcut is the first known work of art alluding to a Lutheran Holy Communion service. D\u00fcrer included a representation of the chalice on the table to emphasize the communion of the congregation with wine; the enameller has avoided this detail.",
