    "Description": "The son of a miniaturist, Baker spent almost his whole life in New York City, except for a trip to Italy in around 1846. He studied at the National Academy of Design. He was one of the most sought after portraitists of his time, but also painted ideal pieces, such as \"Love at First Sight,\" and \"The May Queen\" (present location unknown). This is a rare example of his work as a genre painter. Baker seems to have found particular favor with William T. Walters. The artist was also commissioned to portrayed Ellen Harper Walters, William's wife, and their daughter, Jennie (see WAM 37.2637 and WAM 37.1207).The Walters Art Museum owns 8 works by this artist; his works can also be found at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.",
