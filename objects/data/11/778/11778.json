    "Description": "The beautiful Sakura-hime (Cherry Princess) cowers with fright as a crazed and tattered stalker appears out of the night. She is haunted by the ghost of Seigen, a former priest at the Kiyomizu temple, who had gone insane when Sakura-hime rejected his love. He was so obsessed he put on a robe with cherry blossoms and went around shrieking her name until he was excommunicated. He eventually starved himself to death, vowing that his spirit would follow her wherever she went. Sakura-hime ultimately died of fright.",
