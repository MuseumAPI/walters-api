    "Description": "The head, carved in the round, has human ears and a hair cap. There is a garland of leaves and a flower on the forehead.\r\n\r\nA cut on the lower left edge has removed the tip of the mustache. The head is hollowed out and a fill material plugs the upper opening.\r\n\r\nAlthough the head is that of a man, it has the attributes usually associated with satyrs' heads on furniture mounts- the fierce expression, mustache, and garland in the hair.",
