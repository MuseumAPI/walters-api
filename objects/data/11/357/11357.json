    "Description": "\"Kolty\" (singular \"kolt\") are pendants that attached to a woman's headdress at the temples. The hollow space within the two concave gold disks that compose a \"kolt\" contained perfumes or scented oils. The pendants were usually decorated on both sides, since they could rotate as the woman walked. This \"kolt\" is decorated with delicate cloisonn\u00e9 enamel, a technique learned from Byzantine masters starting in the late 10th century. \"Kolty\" were frequently worn at wedding ceremonies; the lilies (center), birds, and seeds that fleck the birds' breasts are all symbols of fertility. The bird is also an image retained from Russia's pagan past.",
