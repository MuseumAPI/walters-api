    "Description": "This tapestry fragment, depicting the haloed head of a woman, was likely part of a domestic curtain or wall hanging.Curtains and wall hangings were used in private homes, as well as in public and religious buildings, to prevent drafts, divide spaces, and provide privacy. The tapestry weave of this piece is ideal for such textiles, as it produces a design that can be viewed from either side.\r\n\r\nThe woman, wearing earrings and a necklace with pendant, may be a personification. Different colors are used to achieve modeling of the cheeks, chin, and nose, and a subtle alteration of the weave distinguishes the lower edge of the face from the neck.",
