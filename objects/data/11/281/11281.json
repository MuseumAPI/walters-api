    "Description": "From 1848-71, Pasini resided in Paris and found inspiration in the atmospheric North African views of Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin. In 1855, he accompanied a French diplomatic expedition to Iran and also stopped in Turkey and Egypt. He returned to the Near East on a number of occasions, once traveling with fellow artist Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. In this courtyard scene, Pasini has captured the subtle effects of the subdued light on the stucco walls, the tiles, and the lattice window.",
