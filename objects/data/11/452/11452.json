    "Description": "Perhaps the finest of the early Limoges enamellers was the Master of the Triptych of Louis XII. The name given to this anonymous artist, who must have enjoyed considerable princely patronage, derives from a triptych in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which has on its wings portraits of King Louis XII of France and his consort, Anne of Brittany. \r\n\r\nThe luminous blues, the mulberry, ochre and greens of this triptych are subtly balanced to create an intimate and tragically moving mood. The intensity and purity of the colors recall the splendor of stained-glass windows and it is not surprising, therefore, to find that such windows did in fact occasionally serve as models for this artist's compositions.",
