At first, the king is angry that Vessantara gave away his children, but they come to their father's defense. Relieved that his grandchildren are safe, the king gives Jujaka great riches, including a large palace. The children are cleaned up and dressed as royalty, and King Sanjaya sends his army to the forest to retrieve Vessantara and Maddi; the family is joyously reunited. The scene depicted here is the return of the children to the palace.",
