    "Description": "Bow fibulae are also called \"digitated\" fibulae due to the radiating knobs that resemble fingers or digits emerging from the headplate. The knobs of early (4th-century) fibulae were functional and held the springs of the pin. At a later date, as in this five-knobbed example made in the first half of the 6th century, the knobs were purely decorative. This five-knobbed fibula is set with red glass pastes on the digits and garnets on the bow. It is a type commonly found in northern France and the Rhineland.",
