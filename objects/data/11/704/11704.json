She carries the palm of a martyr and the sword of her execution, and she wears on her left hand the ring of her mystical marriage with Christ. She is dressed in a mantle trimmed with fur and a belted gown, with a purse hanging at her right, and is adorned with a necklace and earrings of pearls. Before her is the broken rim of the toothed wheel of her torture. The black background is powdered with stars. At the base is a tablet inscribed in gilding S. CATHARINA, and the monogram IL, with a fleur-de-lys between the two letters.",
