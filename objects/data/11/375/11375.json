    "Description": "The left panel, an endemically Russian composition, depicts a church hymn entitled \"In Thee Rejoiceth,\" in which all of creation praises the Virgin. The Virgin is shown enthroned in heaven with the infant Christ in her lap and God the Father behind her. She is surrounded by angels. Legions of saints, led by John the Baptist, offer her their praise. \r\n\r\nThe central panel depicts the Resurrection, depicted in two complementary compositions: above, Christ emerging triumphantly from the tomb, and, below, the Descent of Christ into Hell. On the sides are twelve scenes of church holidays, arranged in order of their dates: the Birth of the Virgin, the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday), the Transfiguration, the Ascension, the Holy Trinity (Gen. 18:1-15), the Dormition of the Virgin, and the Elevation of the Holy Cross.\r\n\r\nThe right panel depicts the Last Judgment. Christ, as the Ruler of All, sits in judgment on the last day, rewarding the faithful, to his right, with salvation, and the sinners, to his left, with damnation, represented here by the gaping mouth of a horrible beast.",
