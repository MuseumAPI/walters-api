    "Description": "The Old Testament Book of Judges recounts that Sisera, commander of the Canaanite army, fled when his army was routed during battle with the Israelites. The woman Jael lured Sisera into her tent by offering him shelter but then killed him by driving a tent peg into his temple while he slept. By killing Sisera, Jael rescued the Israelites from years of oppression by the Canaanite king Jabin. The plaque is from a series, including the companion plaque, Solomon Turning to Idolatry (Walters 44.197).",
