The artist places this scene by the walls of Jerusalem. Concepts of architectural grandeur prevalent in Europe at the end of the 18th century have led the artist to introduce vast classical buildings behind the city walls. Andrea Appiani, a Milanese artist, served as Napoleon's court painter in Italy.\r\n",
