    "Description": "This miniature vessel consists of a small chamber atop four peg feet. Knobs on opposite sides are zoomorphic heads, likely either feline or saurian. The incised ornamentation of the vessel body consists of a percentage-sign-like motif, framed by fine impressed chevron banding motifs also seen in Tairona gold work. This decorative pattern, paired with heads facing opposite directions, is a fairly common motif in late Tairona art. It has been interpreted as a canoe, reflecting the importance of maritime trade among the Caribbean islands and potentially symbolizing a comparable 'mobility' through supernatural realms. As such, it is likely this small vessel was used to hold a hallucinogenic substance, likely in a powdered form.",
