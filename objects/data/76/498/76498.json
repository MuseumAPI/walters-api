    "Description": "This small intaglio (incised carving) depicts two birds, one of which sits on a basket-like nest. Both figures are well carved, and the composition is artistically conceived. On the evidence of similar examples, it appears to have been created in a Greco-Roman workshop and then imported into South Arabia by a traveler, trader, or other agent. It is likely that the object had an amuletic as well as ornamental function.",
