    "Description": "This view of a couple boating is characteristic of Bricher's paintings during the 1880s, when he was based at Lake George, New York. Although younger than Heade and Sonntag, Bricher shared their commitment to precise representation of the landscape in varying climatic conditions. \r\n\r\nBricher began to paint in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and along the Maine and Massachusetts coastline. In 1869, he moved to New York City, where he pursued a successful career as a fashionable landscape artist.",
