    "Description": "This door, carved with a linen-fold decoration, was probably a back or interior door of a middle-class home.  It is remarkable for its cat hole.  Few doors with cat holes have survived from this early period, but the 14th-century English writer Geoffrey Chaucer described one in the \"Miller's Tale\" from his Canterbury Tales.  In the narrative, a servant whose knocks go unanswered, uses the hole to peek in: \"An hole he foond, ful lowe upon a bord/ Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe,/ And at the hole he looked in ful depe,/ And at the last he hadde of hym a sighte.\"",
