    "Description": "This bottle shaped vase, with a bulge in the neck and flared mouth, is one of a pair painted in underglaze cobalt blue on white porcelain. They are examples of export porcelain from China to Europe or the Near East and include a mixture of cultural motifs. Elaborate floral decorations covering the body and neck of the vase are influenced by Turkish Isnik pottery. Where the shoulder and neck meet are tre-foil designs filled with chrysanthemum sprays, a common domestic decoration. \r\n\r\nTransitional period (c.a. 1620-83) blue and white porcelain concentrated heavily on foreign markets and private commissions. The Manchu occupation in China closed the larger Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen, original the capital of porcelains. The private kilns with private and foreign customers were able to produce high quality blue and white porcelain. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. \r\n",
