    "Description": "In Nuremberg, around 1600, such covered wine cups were called \"Trauben\" (grapes, cluster of grapes) cups. The cup was made from a sheet of silver beaten out into \"grape\" shapes before gilding. Covered cups of this immense size (requiring more than three quarts of wine to fill it) and impressive workmanship were commissioned as special gifts. \r\n\r\nKellner's talent as a sculptor as well as goldsmith comes out in the elegant figure of the Roman goddess Diana atop the cup and the figure which serves as the stem of the cup, Bacchus, Roman god of wine. At his feet is the satyr Pan with his pipes.",
