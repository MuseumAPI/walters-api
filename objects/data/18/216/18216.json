    "Description": "Andrea di Bartolo was the son of the painter Bartolo di Fredi. Like most boys, he began his career in his father's workshop. Although scenes of the Madonna and Child flanked by saints are common, this inclusion of the four Evangelists and their symbols is rare, perhaps even unique. Mark with his lion and John with his eagle are to Mary's right; Matthew with his winged man and Luke with his ox kneel to her left. The infant Christ, who wears a beautiful transparent garment, raises his right hand in blessing and holds a European goldfinch, a symbol of the Resurrection, in his left hand.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this piece, please see Zeri catalogue number 31, pp. 51-52.",
