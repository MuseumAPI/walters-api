    "Description": "Dwarfs played an important role in Egyptian society from Predynastic times. Dwarfism-a genetic condition characterized by unusually short stature and shortened limbs-is frequently represented in Egyptian tomb reliefs and statues. They were believed, because of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods. Figurines of dwarfs were used as amulets and have been found in tombs as well as in ritual places.\r\n\r\nThis figurine represents a female dwarf. She has a large forehead, perforations at the eyes to allow for inlay, and incised curved ridges to denote the brow. The upper arms are fat, the chest narrow, the hips wide, and the legs short and twisted. The wide pubic triangle is marked by a pattern of drilled holes. It is likely that this figure was used to secure fertility.",
