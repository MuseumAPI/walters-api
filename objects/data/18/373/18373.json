    "Description": "The ancient Greeks conceived of their messenger gods-divinities who carried messages to other gods or humans-as winged, alluding to their swiftness and their ability to go anywhere. Iris and Hermes were the main messenger gods in Greek mythology. This bronze displays characteristic attributes of Hermes: a mantle (\"chlamys\"), a winged hat (\"petasos\"), small wings on his ankles, a purse (as he was the god of merchants), and, originally, a herald's staff (\"kerykeion\"), which was an attribute for Iris as well.",
