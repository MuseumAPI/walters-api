    "Description": "The body language of the older boy with his hand on hip is more assertive than that of the younger one, surely his little brother. It is a subtle sign of a social role indicating protection and authority.\r\n\r\nDonker was a portraitist known for his outdoor family groups, in which he sometimes collaborated with a landscape specialist. This rugged landscape with its penetrating, warm light suggests that of Italy and is probably the product of just such as collaboration.\r\n",
