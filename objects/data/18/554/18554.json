    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscripts W.106 depicts a scene from Exodus, in which the Israelites escape their bondage in Egypt. After God sent many plagues, the Pharaoh at last agreed to let the Israelites leave, but then changed his mind and pursued them. The Israelites crossed over the Red Sea, after God had made all the sea dry land. In this image, Moses used Gods power to allow the waters to return, drowning Pharaoh's army.",
