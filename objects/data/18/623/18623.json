    "Description": "As described in the Old Testament book of 2 Samuel (11:2), King David gazes at Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, from the roof of his palace while she bathes. The king's infatuation with Bathsheba will lead him to order her husband's death and take her as his wife. Later, God causes Bathsheba's and David's newborn son to die as punishment.\r\n\r\nVenetian painters, such as Bordone, were particularly known for their ability to paint beautiful, seductive women. The painting is characteristic of Bordone's fondness of fantastic architectural settings and deep perspective.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 271, p. 398.",
