    "Description": "The splendid split-sleeve jacket and fine lace collar, the height of English court fashion in the late 1630s, suggest that the sitter belongs to the English aristocracy. Janssen was among the portraitists influenced by the elegant style introduced in England by Sir Anthony van Dyck, as can be seen in his \"Portrait of Prince Rupert\" (Walters 37.233). The painter was born in London and spent his career there and in Holland.",
