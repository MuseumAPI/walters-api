    "Description": "Bearded, standing, wearing a long chlamys which is fastened on the right shoulder and has a ball at each of three corners. In the outstretched left hand is a vase. The figure wears low soft shoes. His hair is divided into thick locks over his forehead and at the back of his neck. The statue is attached to an ancient base, but does not belong with it. \r\n\r\nThis is a member of a group of statues which Reinach considered to be the Celtic Zeus or Dispater wielding a hammer (\"R\u00e9p. statuaire,\" vi, p. 118, no. 7). However, the hammer is missing and the vase might be an attribute of Herakles, whom the pose and features suggest, despite the drapery.",
