    "Description": "The Gospel text in this Constantinopolitan manuscript of ca. 1000 is now fragmentary and its folios are bound out of order. However, it provides a fine and quite early example of the so-called pearl script: a calligraphic form of minuscule handwriting that was extremely popular in the Byzantine Empire. The single surviving miniature is of interest because of the peculiar technique, similar to watercolor, in which it was painted. Another Evangelist portrait from the same set survives in Mount Athos, Docheiariou Monastery MS 56.",
