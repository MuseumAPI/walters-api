    "Description": "This tonsured monk is represented kneeling. His cowl is thrown back, and his left arm is raised to cover his heart. A rosary and a crucifix hang at his side. The figure wears the distinctive habit of the Carthusians and may represent Saint Bruno, the founder of that strict order. Italian representations of this saint, who was canonized only in 1623, are fairly rare. The south Italian origin may relate to the fact that when Bruno left the service of Pope Urban II in 1090, he established his second charterhouse at La Torre, in Calabria, where he died. Ivory is an especially appropriate medium for representing the white robes of the Carthusians.\r\n\r\nThe saint's right arm, which was a separate piece, is missing.",
