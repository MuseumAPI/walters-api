    "Description": "Rather than recording the quaint, but impoverished circumstances of the \u00c9couen villagers, Soyer records a scene of happy domesticity. A young child gazes inquisitively at his grandmother, who has fallen asleep with her glasses in her lap. Beside her is a cat lapping its food. On the floor are potential threats to this tranquil scene-a toy drum and drumsticks. A vase of flowers on the mantel adds a cheerful note to the rustically, but adequately furnished room.",
