    "Description": "The identification deity Vajrabhairava conquers death and is an aspect of the bodhisattva of wisdom, Manjusri (whose head is his crowning head). He masters a buffalo demon, who stands for ignorance, and has incorporated a buffalo head among his own. At the very top is a small figure of Buddha Shakyamuni; among those joining him are Atisha (died 1054), who carried Buddhist texts from India to Tibet, and the reformist teacher Tsongkhapa (1357-1419), founder of the Gelugpa order. At bottom center is the red Mahakala, a protector deity.",
