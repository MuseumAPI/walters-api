    "Description": "According to legend, around 1300, angels carried the Virgin's cottage in Nazareth-site of the miracle of the incarnation (God conceived in human form)- to Loreto, Italy. Here, the Virgin, holding Jesus and a chalice, sits on her house to suggest her presence there. An angel holds a scroll inscribed in Latin: \"Holy Mary of Loreto, pray for us.\" Wild animals, including a unicorn, are tamed by the Virgin's purity. Two chapels devoted to the House at Loreto were built with the support of the archdukes, and Isabella had a replica of it built for the Franciscans.",
