    "Description": "Elaborate crucifixes became increasingly popular during the Renaissance. This example combines a translucent rock crystal crucifix terminating in gold mounts with enameled strawberries (symbols of goodness), pansies (symbols of humility), and multicolored quatrefoils. The skull and crossbones below the feet of Christ appear on many examples and refer to the belief that the crucifixion took place directly over Adam's grave. The three loops attached to the side and lower ends of the crucifix once bore pearls.",
