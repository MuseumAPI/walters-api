    "Description": "Crazed by grief, a mother searches for her kidnapped child, only to discover that he died a year earlier at the spot beside the Sumida River that she has just reached. Brought to a grassy mound by a willow tree, under which the child was buried, she is asked by the villagers to lead their prayers to Amida Buddha. While they are chanting, the child repeatedly appears before her eyes.\r\n\tMother:\tIs it you, my child?\r\n\tGhost:\tIs it you, my mother?\r\n                  Chorus:    And as she seeks to grasp it by\r\n                                    the hand,\r\n\t\tThe shape begins to fade away;\r\n\t\tThe vision fades and reappears\r\n\t\tAnd stronger grows her yearning.\r\n\t\tDay breaks in the eastern sky.\r\n\t\tThe ghost has vanished;\r\n\t\tWhat seemed her boy\r\n\t\tIs but a grassy mound\r\n\t\tLost on the wide, desolate moor.\r\n\t\tSadness and tender pity fill all hearts,\r\n\t\tSadness and tender pity fill all hearts!\r\n",
