    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.639 is a 10th-century AH/AD 16th Safavid copy of the first collection of poetry, or Divan-i avval (also known as Fatihat al-shabab), of Nur al-Din Jami (died 898 AH/AD 1492), written in 884 AH/AD 1479. The binding is Ottoman and is attributable to the 12th century AH/AD 18th. It is not contemporary with the manuscript. It is of the type sometimes referred to as \u00e7ah\u00e2rk\u00fbse' cild, from the Persian chahar gushah (4 corners), where the spine and edges of the boards are covered with leather and the main area consists of paper, in this case marbled paper.",
