    "Description": "The jar is of spherical form supported on a splayed foot and surmounted by a high flared neck.  Two thin scrolled coils are applied opposite each other at the midsection pressed with enough force to make a slight indentation.  Two stamped rows of scalloped borders and cicada-like motifs with heart-shaped bodies enclosing multi dot bands encircle the body.  A series of zig-zag, crescent and line border are stamped and carved above the foot.  The neck is stamped with trailing trefoil motifs above radiating lines of multi-dots on the shoulder.  \r\n\r\nSome of the stamped jars that have been found in tombs were used as urns, in accordance with the Buddhist preference for cremation. Buddhism had become the official religion of the Silla period in 528.",
