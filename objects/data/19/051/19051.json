    "Description": "This bottle shaped vase with a bulge in the neck is an example of export porcelain to Holland. It represents both domestic and foreign designs and tastes, including Chinese images and decorations that cater to a Dutch market. The body is painted with a scene from the Chinese novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\". The character Liu Bei is depicted moments before his piebald horse vaults him over the River Tan to safety as the conspirators that have planned to kill him pursue. A landscape of trees and a crenellated wall masked by white mist acts as the setting for the scene.  The neck of the vase is decorated with Arabesque tulip motifs, a response to the Dutch attraction to tulips.\r\n \r\nExploitation of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen caused an influx of porcelain artists to begin private practice at private kilns during the Transitional period (1620-1683) between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Manchu occupation of China also shut down most of the imperial kilns. Private kilns produced functional and economic shapes, painted with naturalist subjects (human figures, animals, landscapes) based on wood block illustrations from novels. Export porcelains continued to ship to European and Japanese markets. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
