    "Description": "This delicate amphora shaped flower vase is covered with a peach bloom glaze of mottled reds and pinks. Distinguishing traits of the glaze include clouds of apple green on the body and inside the flared mouth which is decorated with a silver rim (possibly a Japanese addition). Amphora peach bloom vases are characterized by their slender bodies, narrow feet, and flared mouths and are called liuye ping (\"willow leaf vase\") for their resemblance to the leaves of a willow tree. They are also referred to as Guanyin vases, alluding to the Bodhisattva Guanyin whom carries a vessel of a similar form containing ambrosia. Coincidentally the branch of a willow tree is also a symbol of Guanyin. \r\n\r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table, including small flower vases, brush washers, and boxes for seal paste. The spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
