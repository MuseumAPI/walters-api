    "Description": "This length of bone has been worked into a rectangular form and marked off with three dice. The numbers are indicated by dotted circles. Only three sides of the piece have been finished. Eventually the dice would have been separated, the natural hollows of the bone plugged by additional pieces of bone, and numbers carved on all six sides. Unfinished lengths such as these are probably from a bone carver's workshop.",
