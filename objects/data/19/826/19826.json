    "Description": "These panels were the folding wings of a small triptych: paintings on three attached panels used for private devotion. An image of the Virgin and Child would probably have occupied the central panel.\r\n\r\nOne of the wings illustrates the most famous episode in the legendary St. Christopher's life, when he helped a child cross a river by carrying him on his shoulders: Christopher found the small child to be incredibly heavy, only to discover that he was, in fact, Jesus. The opposite panel shows the Crucifixion with the mourning Mary and John the Evangelist.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the 14th century, Pisa nourished a rich, diverse artistic environment, where a unique painting style emerged out of the cross-influences from the schools of Siena and Florence.",
