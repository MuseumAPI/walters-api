    "Description": "Although Chinese folklore disparaged dogs, in Japan they came to be regarded positively as dispellers of evil and portenders of easy childbirth. They symbolize the eleventh year in the Chinese and Japanese 12-year cycle. In this example, the crouching animal wears a rope leash. Tomotada, a gifted animal carver, was particularly noted for carvings of oxen with rope halters. He attracted many pupils, who were permitted to sign their own work as his.",
