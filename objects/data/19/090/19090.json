    "Description": "Clerics known as \"dabtara\" specialized in the creation of prayer scrolls like this for people suffering from curses or physical afflictions. The length of the scroll was custom-made to match the height of its owner, creating a physical connection between scroll and owner that enhanced the object's efficacy. Each scroll included a mixture of prayers, spells, and images that aided in the healing process and were specific to the person's condition. Scrolls were generally rolled and worn by their owners until the desired effect was achieved.",
