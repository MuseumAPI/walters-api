    "Description": "The victorious Genji general Naozane spies a defeated Heike warrior heading on horseback into the sea, where he is hoping to make it to his clan's fleet, anchored offshore. \"It is cowardly to turn your back on your enemy,\" Naozane cries, beckoning with his fan, \"come back!\" The warrior returns to fight, and Naozane beheads him. But it is a tragic episode, for the warrior is but a youth, and at dawn, before the battle began, his flute playing had been heard by all.",
