    "Description": "A \"three-string\" vase (in Chinese sanxian ping) is characterized by the three rings molded in the porcelain where the body and neck meet. The slender neck rises to a flared mouth. A second title is zun ping, or \"turnip vase\" for the vase's wide shoulders and tapering body. This vase of the distinct sanxian ping shape consists of a white porcelain body painted with Taoist symbols in underglaze cobalt blue and red. Aligned horizontally beneath the high shoulders of the vessel are the Eight Mystic Trigrams, each symbolizing a different element of the natural world. Each trigram consists of three figures; the solid lines signify yin while the broken lines signify yang. For example, three unbroken yang lines signify heaven while three broken yin lines symbolize earth. Beneath the trigrams are four medallions of the complimentary opposite energies yin and yang painted with red and blue. The sweeping and crashing waves that rise from the foot of the vase represent the seas which surround the great mountain believed to be the center of the universe. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.\r\n",
