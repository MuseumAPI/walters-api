    "Description": "The drunken Silenus, ribald companion of the wine-god Bacchus, is depicted with his attendants crowning him with garlands, carrying cornucopias with grapes, and pressing wine, activities associated with Bacchic ecstasy and appropriate for what was probably a drinking vessel. The image shows the influence of an engraving made more than a century earlier by the artist Annibale Carracci (1560-1609), whose works continued to inspire artists of the succeeding generations.",
