Lead seals like the present one originally held these cords together so that they could not be tempered with. The versified inscription here identifies the owner of the seal (and the author of the piece of correspondence to which it was attached) as one Michael Boilas, sebastos (an honorific title). The obverse carries an image of his namesake and heavenly protector, the Archangel Michael. Cf. Walters 55.95 and 55.96.",
