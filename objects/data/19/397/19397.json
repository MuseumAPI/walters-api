    "Description": "This stained glass panel, once part of a pair of windows from the Lady Chapel at Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, represents Saint Vincent of Saragossa who was martyred in Gaul (France) in AD 304 under Emperor Diocletian. Saint Vincent's arms and legs are locked into a cross-shaped rack while men tear at his flesh with iron hooks. A hand at the upper left commands the torture. Saint Vincent suffers calmly, enduring great physical pain rather than deny his Christian faith. The panel reminded worshipers that their earthly sufferings would be rewarded in heaven.",
