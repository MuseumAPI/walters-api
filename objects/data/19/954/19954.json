    "Description": "The inscription on the back of the plate identifies the subject: \"il rapimento/ delena,\" or the Rape (abduction) of Helen. When a young girl, Helen was said to have been kidnapped by Theseus as a potential bride. She was cared for and guarded by his mother Aethra, and, years later, she was rescued by her brothers Castor and Pollux. This is the scene depicted, not the famous story of her later abduction by the Trojan prince Paris. Castor, renowned for his skill with horses, lifts up Helen and rides away on a rearing steed, and Pollux, known for his skill in boxing, incapacitates Aethra by lifting her off the ground.",
