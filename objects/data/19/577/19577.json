    "Description": "Joseph, one of the biblical patriarch Jacob's twelve sons, was thrown into a pit by his brothers, who resented their father's favoritism towards him. Although they sold him into slavery, he rose to become master of Egypt (Genesis 37).\r\n\r\nRembrandt's dramatic, shadow--filled interpretation of biblical subjects--reflected in the \"Vision of Cornelius the Centurion\" by his pupil Eeckhout-was not the only approach popular in Amsterdam. David Colyn, who signed and dated this picture, offers us a daylight scene with details of rural life that is closer to the imagery of contemporary landscape painting.\r\n",
