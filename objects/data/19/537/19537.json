A pack of dogs attacks one boar, while another boar is pursued by an archer and a mounted spearman accompanied by dogs.\r\n\r\nThe handle of the pestle is decorated with raised designs on a pounced and stained ground. Above, pseudo coats of arms, from which bows are suspended, alternate with martial trophies; below, a zigzag ribbon enlivens the surface.\r\n\r\nAn old label reads: \"112.\"",
