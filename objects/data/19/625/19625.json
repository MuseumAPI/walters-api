    "Description": "The scene painted on the lid of this covered bowl may depict a scene from a novel. An official figure seated under a pavilion faces a seated figure with a scroll. A military man stands on the left side of the scene with a military standard while another figure on the right appears to be holding an elephant tusk or another scroll. The final figure of the scene is a man that fans the seated individual. A tree overhangs the pavilion and the figures. Around the sides of the scene are branches filled with persimmons and small birds.\r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain. During the reign of Wanli (1573-1619) corrupt exploitation of the Jingdezhen kilns for economic reasons led to an increase in private kiln production, patronage and subsequently the quality of blue and white porcelain. \r\n",
