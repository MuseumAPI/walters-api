    "Description": "The Madonna and Child are richly clothed and bedecked with jewelry. The long gold, gemstone, and coral necklace of Christ as well as the gold and garnet (?) brooch of the Madonna are carried out in pastiglia (a form of applied relief decoration). The composition is full of symbols: the European goldfinch signifies the Passion; the apple in the hand of Christ alludes to the Original Sin; the floral garland, which includes a carnation and a rose, symbolizes the purity and love of the Virgin; and the coral branch incorporated in the child's necklace was believed to ward off evil.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 117, pp. 178-179.",
