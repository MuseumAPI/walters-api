    "Description": "The roundel at center shows the nymph Leda making love with Zeus, the king of the gods, in the shape of a swan. This resulted in the birth of twin boys Castor and Pollux, also included in the scene. One of the twins is crawling out of a large egg. This light-hearted treatment of an amorous adventure of the ancient gods is enhanced by the encircling bands of decoration consisting of the antique egg-and-dart motif combined with little faces, then hosts of chubby putti (playful winged infant deities). Such a display of multiple figures in different poses was characteristic of the late 16th-century love of complexity.",
