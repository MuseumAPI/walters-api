    "Description": "This faience scarab is the centerpiece of a winged scarab amulet with a flat underside and drill-holes at the bottom. The design of the back is very detailed, with deeply incised hatch lines for the wing cases and irregular line flow. The pattern is unevenly spaced, the proportions of the top are balanced and the extremities are slender. The piece is very carefully made, and the workmanship is good.\r\n\r\nThis scarab functioned as a funerary amulet and was originally attached to mummy bandages along with wings. Winged scarabs should assure the renewal of the deceased by meeting the sun god in the afterlife.\r\n\r\nFriezes with a pearl pattern are not very common for scarabs with flat undersides, but were popular for natural formed scarabs.",
