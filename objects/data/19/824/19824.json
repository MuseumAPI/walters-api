    "Description": "One of Miller's early sketches prepared for the Scottish adventurer and aristocrat Sir William Drummond Stewart, this picture has its origin in a drawing the artist made of Black Harris, a trapper, and his brother escaping from the Blackfeet. Miller noted that Harris \"always created a sensation at the camp fire\" with his dramatic story of the escape. Here Miller depicted Stewart in Harris' place. As Miller noted, stories such as this made a \"prime after dinner story for England.\"",
