    "Description": "\"Pinakes\" (singular \"pinax\") are decorated plaques made usually of terracotta, but also of wood, ivory, stone, or metal, which were often dedicated as offerings in sanctuaries. The holes were used to hang them within the sanctuary on walls, trees, or even on the cult image of the deity. The terracotta examples were produced by the same pottery workshops that made vases. This black-figure example shows a \"prothesis\" scene, the lying-in-state of the deceased on a bed, surrounded by his family members, some of whom tear their hair in mourning.",
