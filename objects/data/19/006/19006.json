    "Description": "This oval carnelian amulet was apparently injured by fire and was originally a pale yellow or flesh color. It is mounted in gold as a stick pin.\r\n\r\nThe obverse depicts a ouroboros with its head at the top, enclosing a design. Directly below the head of the ouroboros is a small oval enclosing five stars (?) indiciated by small crosses. Below that are several magical characters and the letters HB. Below this is the main design, very uncertain. It depicts a table or couch on which rests a small mummy with its head bent up, or perhaps a chid in swaddling-bands. At the right is a serpent with horns, or perhaps a lion-headed serpent. At the left is what is apparently a serpent with a large head. The body of the snake is supported on the hind legs of some animal, possibly a dog. Below are two lines of characters with a few letters. At the bottom, what is perhaps a jackal is depicted running to the left. \r\n\r\nThe reverse is plain.",
