    "Description": "A staff of priests and priestesses performed the daily rituals of the Egyptian temple. A chief priest tended to the cult image of the temple's god or goddess, in the name of the king, who was thought to have daily need of food and clothing. Lesser ranking priests attended to offerings and performed the minor parts of the temple rituals. Incense burners were used extensively in temple and funerary ceremonies to purify the sacred space. \r\n\r\nThe handle of this incense burner ends in a falcon's head. At the center is a figure of a king kneeling before a cartouche-shaped pan that held incense pellets. The other end (now missing) was shaped like a hand holding a small pan for burning the incense.",
