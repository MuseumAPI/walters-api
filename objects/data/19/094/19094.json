    "Description": "This painting is inspired by the allegorical poem \"The Triumphs,\" written by the Italian poet Petrarch (1304-1374). Chastity is enthroned on a triumphal chariot drawn by swans, symbols of purity. Her triumph is indicated by the presence of Cupid, the god of love, blindfolded and bound as her prisoner. The dog leading the procession also represents fidelity. Behind the chariot are the Three Graces, whose nudity symbolizes unadorned beauty, sincerity, and truth.\r\n\r\nThe painting was probably part of the furnishing in a Tuscan house. Pseudo-Granacci is the name given to an unknown artist whose works are frequently confused with paintings by his Florentine contemporary Francesco Granacci (1469-1543).\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 203, pp. 315-316.",
