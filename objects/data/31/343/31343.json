    "Description": "The bands of small roses at the top of the two scenes identify this plaque as one of the \"Rose Group\" of ivories, characterized by their carefully arranged figures and graceful poses.  The upper register shows the Crucifixion, with Christ accompanied by Mary and the Roman soldier Longinus (left) and Stephaton, the sponge-bearer, and St. John (right).  Below is the scene of the Flagellation, noteworthy for the curved, almost mannered poses of the figures. Originally this panel was paired with a right leaf showing the Deposition and Entombment, now in the British Museum, London.",
