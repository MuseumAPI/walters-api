    "Description": "This cup is an example of export porcelain from China to Europe. While the porcelain body and underglaze cobalt blue designs are original, later additions such as a fluted silver gilt rim and the red and gold overglaze enamels can be attributed to a European painter in the style of Chinese decorative motifs. Bands of Ruyi heads aligned on the upper rim and along the bottom of the cup are a traditional pattern utilized in Chinese blue and white porcelain; the heart shaped motifs depict the curved head of the ruyi scepter, a symbol of monastic authority in Buddhism. Flowers and foliated designs are painted in the space between the two bands. The cup consists of a tapered cylindrical body standing upon a round foot rim.",
