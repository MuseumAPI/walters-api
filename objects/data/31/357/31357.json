    "Description": "Very structured incised, stamped, and applied decoration covering nearly the entire vessel is characteristic of later 16th-century stoneware in the Rhineland, especially the Westerwald region. Horizontal bands around the middle separate vertical stripes at the bottom that imitate the pattern called \"gadrooning\" in higher-status contemporary glassware designs (imitating Roman glass) from divided fields of alternating patterns or motifs above. The decorative effect is accentuated by selectively painting cobalt blue oxide on the naturally gray body prior to salt glazing during firing. This type is also called a \"beaked\" jug or pot, a \"Schnabelkanne\" in German.",
