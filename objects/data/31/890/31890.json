    "Description": "Splendid caskets were a specialty of Nuremberg goldsmiths in the later 1500s, particularly of Wenzel Jamnitzer (1507-1585) and his family. They were typically commissioned as presents for noblewomen for the safekeeping of small precious objects and but were themselves display pieces. \r\n\r\nThe glass plaques are of the period and are finely executed in the reverse painting technique to create a dazzling impression of gold filigree; however, the metal framing elements were largely replaced or newly constructed in the 1800s by the French goldsmith Alfred Andr\u00e9. The feet in the shape of harpies are similar to the feet of other caskets by Jamnitzer; but related drawings by Andr\u00e9 suggest that these are his.\r\n",
