    "Description": "Over sixty plaques picturing scenes of the \"Aeneid,\" the great epic poem by the Roman poet Virgil that recounts the wanderings of the trojan prince Aeneas are known. Seven are in the Walters collection. The series was probably commissioned to be set in the wainscoting of a small room, perhaps the study of a wealthy man with a classcial education. At the upper right of this plaque Aeneas waits with the Cumean Sibyl for Charon's barge, which will take him across the river Acheron to the entrance of the Underworld, where he will visit his father, Anchises. The mouth of Hell is represented in the gothic manner as the head of a monster.",
