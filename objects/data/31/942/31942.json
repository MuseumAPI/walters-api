    "Description": "\u00d4mori Hikohichi, a 14th-century warrior, is shown with a female demon on his back. Hikohiki is said to have offered to carry a beautiful woman across a stream. While crossing the stream, he saw her reflection as a demon in the water. In some versions of the story he kills her, while in others she runs away. When the story was adapted for use in theatrical dramas, the woman was portrayed as the daughter of Kusunoki no Masahige, who erroneously thought Hikohichi was responsible for her father's death. The daughter was not actually a demon, but wore a mask to frighten Hikohichi. This is part of a set with Walters 51.1074.",
