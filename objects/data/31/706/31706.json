    "Description": "The mitra (head or belt ornament) consists of a roughly semi-circular sheet divided into two wide horizontal registers and a narrow frieze, separated by rows of dots with a border of hatched triangles along the semi-circular edge, and four rows of dots along the top. Most of the figures in the two upper zones were probably worked individually, rather than stamped. In the upper zone are three winged bulls to the right; above each bull is a head, and there are three heads under the center bull. Between the bulls are standing women with long volute locks and transparent garments. On the left and right are pairs of goats. In the second register are two winged bulls opposed, four ducks beneath, four double leaf ornaments, four circle ornaments, and two quadrupeds, perhaps sphinxes, one in each upper corner. In the lowest register is a procession of lions and goats. The lions, goats, heads, ducks, and circles appear to be the same stamps as those found on the pectoral (Walters 57.368). The edges of the sheet are frayed and crumpled. Along the top the metal is rolled back in three places perhaps to form tubes for suspension.",
