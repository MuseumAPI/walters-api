    "Description": "Enamels with bust-length figures of sainted bishops appear on the cup. Depictions of Christ as the Man of Sorrows (Christ with the wounds of his Passion), the Virgin, and John the Evangelist are on the base. The portraits of bishops connected the priest who used the cup to his sacred predecessors. The figure of the dead Christ alludes directly to the object's function as a vessel for sacramental wine, which, according to the Catholic Church, was transformed during the Mass into the blood of Christ.",
