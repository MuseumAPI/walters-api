    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts two scenes from the story of Hannah.  Top: Hannah, the barren wife of Elkanah, went to the temple, where the Ark of the Covenant was, and prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly. She vowed that if God gave her a son, then she would give him to God. Eli the priest saw her praying and thought that she was drunk. \r\n\r\nBottom: In due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called him Samuel. Samuel was to crown David, King of Israel.",
