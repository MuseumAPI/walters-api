    "Description": "This is an example of sacred rather than secular furniture, though the Tibetans use religious symbols on furniture intended for daily use as well. The cabinet was probably used in a \"gonkhang,\" a chapel dedicated to wrathful deities, or could have served as a shrine by itself with images inside. \r\n\r\nVisually, the most striking feature of the cabinet is the composition with the dancing skeletons. They are known as Chitipati, and their origin is obscure. The expression is Sanskrit and combines two words, \"chiti,\" a variation of \"chita,\" meaning charnel ground or funeral pyre, and \"pati,\" meaning lord. Thus, the expression means lord of the pyre, or broadly, of the cremation ground. However, the lord of the charnel field is either Yama, lord of death, or Mahakala, both of whom are served by this skeletal couple. Moreover, it is strange that the couple is known only by one designation, which is clearly male, when they are supposed to be a mixed couple.",
