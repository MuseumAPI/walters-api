    "Description": "The head of this garlanded cupid is from a couch. Three pieces form what remains of the bust and wings; missing elements would have formed the original head and closed off the bottom of the bust. The bone is probably that or a horse or an ox.\r\n\r\nMore complete couches, found in Roman tombs in Italy, show that garlanded cupids ornamented the lower parts of the fulcra. Bone decorations of this type come from funeral couches placed in tombs, but the couches were undoubtedly used also in real life.",
