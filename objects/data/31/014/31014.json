    "Description": "This rare plate was decorated by one of Athens' most important early vase-painters, for whom the Gorgon (a creature with a frightening grimace and snakes for hair) was a favorite subject. Mythical beings such as Gorgons, sphinxes (with a woman's head, an eagle's wings, and a lion's body), and sirens (with a woman's head and a bird's body), all depicted here, were inspired by Eastern models. An owl, panther, goat, lion, and siren form a lively procession around the rim.",
