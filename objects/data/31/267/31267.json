    "Description": "A cone of light cuts through the dark night to reveal a dramatic scene. Sutewakamaru, troubled by conflicting obligations, tries to take his own life by binding himself to a statue of the Bodhisattva Jizo on a rock by the Chigo Deeps. While waiting for the tide to rise and drown him, he is rescued by General Hisayoshi (holding the lantern) and his son. The rescue leads to further complications: Sutewakamaru had previously vowed to kill Hisayoshi to avenge a murder, but now he owes his life to the general.",
