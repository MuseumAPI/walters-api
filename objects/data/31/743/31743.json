    "Description": "This is an \"image de chevet\" (literally, an image hung at or near the head of a bed): a devotional image that one saw first thing in the morning and just before going to bed.  The intent was to provide an inspirational reference that begins and ends the day, here wise leaders from the far reaches of the world and of different races paying homage to Christ's divinity.\r\n  \r\nThe technique of working with enamel painted on copper is characteristic of Limoges, but the composition and the rounded, compact figures reflect French manuscript illumination of the period.",
