    "Description": "Wedding rings are often inscribed; this example features inscriptions in several languages. One cameo of the Roman ring is inscribed with the Greek \"EYTYXI\" (Good luck) and its hoop with the Latin \"DVLCIS VIVAS\" (Live sweetly). The other cameo depicts an elaborate ship, a symbol of the church. Its bezel resembles a fingernail, which suggests that it was worn near the tip of the finger, perhaps just above the third joint.",
