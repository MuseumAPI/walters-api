    "Description": "This painting, Walters manuscript leaf W.876, dating to the 12th century AH/AD 18th, depicts 3 women seated within 2 leafy bowers. The Nayaka (female lover or heroine) sits alone, while her 2 female companions, known as sakhis, converse in the other bower. The painting may represent Utka nayaka, a classification for heroines who are awaiting or yearning for their lovers. Often, they are shown on a bed of flowers or leaves that they have prepared in expectation of meeting their lovers. In the landscape are animals engaged in various activities. An outcrop of rocks in the distance forms a horizon, above which is a blue sky streaked with light gray or white washes to suggest a thin layer of high clouds.",
