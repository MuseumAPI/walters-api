    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.569, an illuminated copy of the Qur'an, was produced in the 11th century AH/AD 17th in Iran. Apart from using a number of scripts, such as Naskh, Muhaqqaq, and Tawqi', the manuscript features 6 pairs of decorated pages; 2 illuminated headpieces; and chapter headings, interlinear illumination, and marginal decoration. The Qur'anic text begins on fol. 2b and ends on fol. 331a. It is followed by a prayer (du'a') and a table of divination (taf'ul) in Arabic and Persian (fols. 332b-333a).The black leather binding has a central piece in the form of a diamond with pendants on 4 sides. The inner boards, with their traditional dentelle decoration, feature text from the \"verse of the throne\" (ayat al-kursi), 2:255-6, which is inscribed in the outer frame.",
