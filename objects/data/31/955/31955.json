    "Description": "What gives this head its unusual appearance is the shape of the eyes: the upper edge, instead of being downcurved, is raised, and the lower edge is nearly straight.  Inverted eyes of this sort can be seen in images of Hindu deities of about the same period.  It is also conceivable that the sculptor intended to evoke a certain 13th-century model.  The modeling has been carried out with impressive subtlety, but in general the overall treatment and proportions differ little from those of a number of images, mostly of the standing Buddha with his right hand in \"abhayamudra.\"",
