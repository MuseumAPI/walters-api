    "Description": "The solemn yet harried preparation for a holiday feast is usually the image accompanying the December calendar in a Book of Hours. The image displayed here is a rare and delightful departure from convention. Through color the artist has beautifully captured the chill of a winter day, and he skillfully conveys the excitement of a snowball fight. All is not play, however, for in the distant background, work still goes on. But for a wonderful moment, the world is a playground.",
