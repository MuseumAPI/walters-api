    "Description": "When the German artist Schreyer moved to Paris in 1862, critics compared his paintings of the Near East to the works of the orientalists Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin. In 1859, Schreyer traveled extensively in Egypt and Syria, learning Arabic and immersing himself in Near Eastern culture.\r\n\r\nSeen is a courtyard of an inn at dawn.  The rising sun bathes the top walls with warm light, leaving the foreground in shadow; horses are being prepared for the day.  One, already packed, is tended by an Arab, three others are saddled, and another, a handsome white steed, drinking water from a well, is watched by a young boy.  Strewn across the ground at the right are various supplies.",
