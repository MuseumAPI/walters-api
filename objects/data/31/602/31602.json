    "Description": "This leaf is from a set depicting musical modes, and it provides a glimpse into the lives of men (yogis) who seek higher truth and union with the god Shiva by disciplining their bodies. The text at top describes the figure who represents the mode (a melodic theme) as an emaciated ascetic \"with his hair besmeared in ashes and clad in the saffron-colored loincloth of a yogi.\" This is the seated figure, accompanied by a small pot for ashes and a trident with a peacock-feather fan. In fact, there is a twist: this seated figure is not a man at all but a woman, who has become so emaciated pining for her lover that she looks like a yogi.",
