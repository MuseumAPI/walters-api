    "Description": "\"As tobacco is a scarce commodity with the Indians they have found a plant of a delicious flavor to mix with it and in default of the former to use in its stead, this is called 'Kinnick, Kinnick,' the leaves resembling in shape the box of the gardens, and is cured by a process similar to that for tobacco.  With a good supply of this article he lays by for a time the deadly war club, and quiver of arrows, - fills his pipe bowl and inhales the fragrant mixture.\" A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
