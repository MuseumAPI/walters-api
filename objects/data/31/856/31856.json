    "Description": "In his depiction of this tender moment between Mary and Christ, the artist emphasizes the figures' human qualities, such as their supple flesh, and the intimate relationship between mother and child. Bartolomeo Vivarini and his brother Antonio led active painting workshops in Venice during the 15th century, mainly producing devotional paintings like this one. During this time, Ethiopian rulers invited Italian painters to their courts, where local artists studied their work. Compare this painting with a traditional Ethiopian icon, especially for the similar arrangement of Mary and Christ, the soft treatment of their bodies, and the close interaction between mother and son.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 165, p. 246.\r\n",
