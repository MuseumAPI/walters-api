    "Description": "According to Greek myth, a king named Danaus ordered his daughter Hypermnestra to kill her husband Lynceus on their wedding night. Because Lynceus was so kind to her, Hypermnestra instead helped him to flee. Danaus attempted to have his daughter put to death, but the court cleared her. Eventually, Lynceus killed Danaus, ruled in his place (here, he takes the crown), and was reunited with Hypermnestra. The plaque reading \"Love conquers all,\" carried by a cupid, foretells this ending. The ancient subject was obscure, so Xanto Avelli included identifying inscriptions under the two male figures.",
