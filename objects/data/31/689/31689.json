The god wears not only a himation which passes under his right arm and over his left shoulder, but also a chiton. He has a very long beard. His hair is bound by a plain band; at the front, small lumps represent curls. The complete drapery is unusual and may be due to provincial origin. There is no sign of tooling after casting.",
