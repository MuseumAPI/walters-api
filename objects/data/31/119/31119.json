    "Description": "M. D. Pape and Jean II P\u00e9nicaud were the great masters of grisaille, a technique in which the composition is painted in a gray monochrome. The boldly incised lines on the enamels of M. D. Pape recall the technique of the engraving which served as his models. The artist executed a number of similar triptychs which illustrate St. John baptizing Christ, preaching, and being beheaded.",
