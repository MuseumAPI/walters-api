    "Description": "A young lady wearing an embroidered mantle and a white satin dress with square d\u00e9colletage is portrayed seated.\r\n\r\nShould the traditional identification of the subject as Lady Clinton (1795-1875) be correct, she would have been about fourteen years old when this style of dress was in fashion. The identification is based on a newspaper clipping, attached to the reverse of the panel bearing the obituary of the Dowager Lady Clinton, second wife of Sir Horace Seymour, who served as \"lady of the bed-chamber\" to Queen Adelaide for several years prior to 1837.",
