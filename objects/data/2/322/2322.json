He trained initially as an engineer but later taught himself to paint in watercolors. He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe \"travel books,\" such as \"Gondola Days\" (1897) and \"The Venice of To-Day\" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.\r\n",
