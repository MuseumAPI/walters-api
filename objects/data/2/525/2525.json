    "Description": "This small wooden cross is carved in relief on both sides. On one side is the Crucifixion, flanked by Saints Peter and Paul, and with the Old Testament Trinity (a composition, also known as the Hospitality of Abraham, in which the Trinity is represented as Abraham's three angelic visitors [Gen. 18:1-15]) at the top, and the Virgin of the Sign at the bottom. In the center of the reverse side is the Archangel Michael, dressed as a Roman soldier. In the context of this personal object, Michael appears in the role of a guardian angel. Above him are a cherub and a seraph, to the left are Saints Nicholas and Basil, to the right Saints John Chrysostom and Gregory. At the bottom are Saints Sergius of Radonezh, Onouphrius, and Macarius.",
