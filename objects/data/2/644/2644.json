    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.640 is an illuminated and illustrated Safavid copy of the first collection of poetry (Divan-i avval or Fatihat al-shabab) by Nur al-Din Jami (died 898 AH/AD 1492). According to the colophon, is was copied by the illustrious Safavid calligrapher Shah Mahmud Nishapuri (died 972 AH/AD 1564-1565) (fol. 306a). The codex opens with a double-page illustrated frontispiece (fols. 1b-2a), which is followed by a double-page illuminated incipit (fols. 2b-3a). There are10 additional paintings that appear to date later than the text itself. These paintings are in the style of Isfahan in the 11th century AH/AD 17th. The textblock, which has been trimmed, is bound in lacquer boards decorated with hunting scenes and landscape motifs. The binding was also executed in Iran and is attributable to the late 10th century AH/AD 16th or 11th century AH/AD 17th. There are several erased seals and one ownership statement on fol. 1a, and a seal impression naming Muhammad Amin is found on fol. 3a.",
