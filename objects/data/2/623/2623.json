Her lavish costume-with a scarf tied to her hair, a brocade dress set with pearls and a feather, and jeweled pendants-communicates her social status, as does the column, suggestive of a palatial setting, a compositional device developed during the 16th century to communicate aristocratic status.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 421, pp. 531-532.",
