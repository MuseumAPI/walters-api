    "Description": "The subject may represent the Ascension in the spirit, an appearance of Christ to his disciples during his supernatural life after the Resurrection. Christ is represented nude, clad only in a loincloth and a flowing mantle, and showing his wounds. The twelve apostles, who manifest various expressions of astonishment and rapture, are distinguished only by their age. They bear no attributes. In the background one sees a town and a mountain ridge.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Christ seems to have been inspired by that in a painting, The Doubting Thomas, executed in 1551, by L\u00e9onard Limosin for the church of Saint-Pierre-du-Queyroix in Limoges. Today this is in the museum at Limoges and was restored in 1963. On the other hand, L\u00e9onard Limosin may have used for his painting a figure of Christ designed by Jean P\u00e9nicaud II for his workshop.",
