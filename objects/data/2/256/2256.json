    "Description": "As described in Jerusalem Delivered, an epic poem by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595) set during the first crusade, the Christian knight Rinaldo has been drawn into the enchanted garden of the sorceress Armida. The mischievous cupid at center holding the hero's helmet calls attention to Rinaldo's transformation from warrior to forlorn lover. Two of Rinaldo's comrades are spying on the couple. They will later persuade Rinaldo to return to battle.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of Rocca's paintings are the fluid brushwork, flickering lights, and luminescent colors, as can be seen in this study for a larger composition. The lightness, wit, and eroticism are all features that link Rocca to the French rococo.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 400, pp. 511-512.\r\n",
