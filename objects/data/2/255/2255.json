    "Description": "The elegant works of Jean-Marc Nattier exemplify mid 18th-century French portraiture.  Although he was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale (Royal Academy) as a painter of historical subjects (then ranked as the highest category of painting), Nattier specialized in the less prestigious genre of portraiture.  Though he worked at the court of Louis XV, he broke with the baroque tradition of grandiose portraits. Instead, he produced naturalistic paintings of Queen Marie Leszczynska and her daughters, as well as Mme. de Pompadour and other members of the nobility.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this light-hearted, informal portrait is the young wife of Antoine-Ren\u00e9 de Voyer d'Argenson, marquis of Paulmy, who was minister of war under Louis XV and French ambassador to Poland.\r\n",
