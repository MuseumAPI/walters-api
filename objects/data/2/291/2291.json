    "Description": "This panel once formed together with its pair 71.159 the side wings of a triptych icon. Each wing is divided into four registers, showing inward-facing figures that originally drew the viewer's attention to the now missing image in the center. The overall arrangement follows a hierarchical order, with a pair of angels in the top register followed by the apostles Paul and Peter and by four martyrs holding crosses.",
