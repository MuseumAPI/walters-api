    "Description": "The scenes are set beneath arcades of six poorly formed arches, topped by crockets. The upper scene is the Anointing of the Body of Christ and the lower the Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\nThe plaque has no hinges and shows traces of having once had a metal frame. It has been broken on the left side and repaired. It is possibly half of a diptych, which was mounted in silver, or was used as a pax.\r\n\r\nThe sharp folds of the Virgin's skirt and the angular posture of her knees are related to German alabaster sculpture of the early 15th century",
