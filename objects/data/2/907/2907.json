    "Description": "Saint Sebastian is shown tied to a tree, from which two angels are releasing him. A third angel is carrying the arrows with which the saint was martyred. The panel probably formed the centerpiece of a small house altar, and originally would have been framed in ebony. There is a small slanting hole in the upper edge of the panel for attachment.\r\n\r\nAngels of similar character can be seen in other Austrian works, such as those by the sculptor Jacob Auer.",
