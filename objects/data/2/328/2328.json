    "Description": "This nude male dancer, wearing a torque and holding two flower staffs, was likely one of a pair or set of such dancers decorating a larger wall hanging or curtain fragment.\r\n\r\nCurtains and wall hangings were used in private homes, as well as in public and religious buildings, to prevent drafts, divide spaces, and provide privacy. The tapestry weave of this piece is ideal for such textiles, as it produces a design that can be viewed from either side.",
