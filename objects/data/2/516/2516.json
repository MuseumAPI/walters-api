The crowned Virgin, in voluminous drapery, holds the naked Christ Child between Mary Magdalen and Saint James Major. The background is plain, and the circular form is brought to a square with four corner leaves, carved in relief and incised with veins.\r\n\r\nMirror cases with religious subjects are rare. \r\n\r\nThere is a hole at the lower edge from a flaw in the ivory and a drilled hole in the upper left leaf.",
