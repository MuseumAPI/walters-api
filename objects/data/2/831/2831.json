    "Description": "Around 20,000 clay tablets were found at the site of K\u00fcltepe (ancient Kanesh). Such a large find indicates that the city had an extensive commercial quarter, where foreign Assyrian merchants lived and operated during the 19th century BC. Sent from Itur-ili in Assyria to Ennam-Ashur in Kanesh, this letter concerns the important trade in precious metals. Itur-ili, the senior partner, offers wise words of advice to Ennam-Ashur: \"This is important; no dishonest man must cheat you! So do not succumb to drink!\"",
