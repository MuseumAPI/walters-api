    "Description": "Walters manuscript leaf W.681, this Safavid single-leaf drawing with opaque watercolor and illuminated borders, depicts a man with a large turban riding a donkey. Attributable to the early 11th century AH/AD 17th, it is in the style of drawing defined by the school of the famous Persian artist Riza 'Abbasi (active 1001-1044 AH/AD 1591-1592 to 1634). The composition is the reverse of a work by the Safavid painter Sadiqi (939-1018 AH/AD 1533-1610) in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre published by Ivan Stchoukine in 1929 that has been identified as a depiction of a mullah (religious scholar). The illuminated borders of landscape scenes and gazelles are slightly later than the drawing and probably date to the late 11th century AH/AD 17th.",
