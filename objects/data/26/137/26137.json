    "Description": "Engraved ivory plaques were incorporated into luxurious small cabinets or chests, but independently conceived plaques set into frames were also valued as self-contained works of art.\r\n\r\nThe style of this minutely detailed scene suggests that of the Flemish engraver and draughtsman Johann Wierix. No engravings on ivory by him are known, but, in addition to prints on paper, he made delicate engravings on silver. During the 1590s, Wierix worked for the Habsburg court in Brussels and subsequently for the Jesuits in Antwerp.\r\n",
