    "Description": "The legendary early Christian martyr Saint Dorothea was the daughter of a Roman senator and was executed because of her faith during the reign of Emperor Diocletian in the early 4th century. On the way to her decapitation, the pagan lawyer Theophilus mockingly asked her to send him fruits from Paradise. Before her death, an angel appeared to her with a basket of flowers and fruits. Saint Dorothea is the patron saint of gardeners.\r\n\r\nHer elegant, long neck and the sword she is holding allude to her martyrdom. The light color scheme, the emphasis on the softness of the pinkish skin, and the flowers all charm the eye in a way that reflects the influence of the rococo style in France.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 392, p. 507.",
