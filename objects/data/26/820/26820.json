    "Description": "Enameled watches from the first half of the 1600s are exceedingly rare.  These watches were purchased for their cases, as show pieces; the movements inserted in them were of a lower quality and poor timekeepers even for the period.  The scintillating appearance of the green is achieved by engraving the surface of the gold case with a dense floral pattern, which was then coated with transparent green enamel.",
