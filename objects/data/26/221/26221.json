    "Description": "Francis of Paola was a 15th-century Franciscan saint. He founded the Order of the Minims and was known for his austere lifestyle. Like Mary Magdalene, St. Francis of Paola had ecstatic visions of being lifted up into heaven by angels. The book and skull on the ground refer to his meditations.\r\n\r\nThe sketchy painting was probably a \"modello\" (preparatory sketch of a composition) for a larger altarpiece.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 380, pp. 497-498.",
