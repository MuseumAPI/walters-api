    "Description": "Pottery vessels in the shape of animals were often used as lekythoi (oil containers). Hunting hares was a popular sport among young men, and a vessel in the shape of the kill was an appropriate gift to a hunting companion. Similar containers are known from Corinth and Rhodes, but the type of clay and other details suggest that this example belongs to a group made by artisans of Greek origin who established workshops in Etruria in the middle of the 6th century BC.",
