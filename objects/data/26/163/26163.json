    "Description": "The undulating bodies of two winged dragons with foliate tails form this letter \"P.\" A profile, bearded, and mustached human face at the very end of the letters tail disgorges a fleshy stalk crowned with large profile leaves, from which emerge two further profile faces. These faces, clean-shaven and connected at the ears, open their mouths in order to eat small flowers or plants that grow from the tops of the leaves--as if devouring the very source of their existence.",
