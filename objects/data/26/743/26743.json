    "Description": "This Gospel Book, with richly painted Evangelist portraits, canon tables, and marginal illuminations, was made in Armenia in the early seventeenth century. An extensive colophon reveals that it was commissioned by a woman named Napat' as a memorial for herself and her family, and the book was consequently given by her to the Church of St. Sargis in Amida. The illuminator of the manuscript, Hovannes, was one of the most prolific among the artists and scribes at the Amida scriptorium. On the present codex he worked with the scribe Melk'on. Known collaborators, Hovannes and Melk'on executed a number of codices together.",
