    "Description": "St. Matthew is depicted receiving inspiration in composing his Gospel from a divinely sent, winged human figure, one of the four winged creatures described in Revelation that were understood as symbolizing the four Evangelists. This painting is from a series of the Four Evangelists that is datable to around 1616 by comparison to a similar, dated series. By contorting the Evangelist's body in a cramped space against a black background, Wtewael (pronounced \"oo-te-vahl\") increases our sense of the saint's stress and concentration. This artificial manipulation is visually intriguing but old fashioned at a time when Bloemaert and others were turning to greater naturalism.",
