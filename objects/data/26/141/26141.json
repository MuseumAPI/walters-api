    "Description": "Luke is clothed in robes and sandals and recalls the tradition of classical author portraits. While he sits on a cushioned bench, he lacks an accompanying desk or lectern, forcing him to balance his book on his left knee. He is somewhat awkwardly posed, for he must reach nearly behind him to dip his quill into his elaborate ink pot. Luke's symbol, the bull, reaches down over his shoulder.",
