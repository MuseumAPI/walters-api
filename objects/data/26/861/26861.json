    "Description": "This ceramic icon shows Saint Nicholas, framed by vine scrolls, raising his right hand in blessing and holding the Gospels in his left hand, which is covered as a sign of respect. This ceramic tile is one of the finest in the Walters collection, which includes over 1,000 fragments, the largest such group outside of Turkey.\r\n\r\nAlthough of unknown origin, this group of tiles is similar to ones known to have been made in Constantinople (now Istanbul). The tiles were most likely attached to a church wall as part of a frieze containing saint portraits and ornamented (non-iconic) pieces. Two further tiles in the museum belong to the same series as this one and carry images of Saint James (Walters 48.2086.9) and Saint Parascheve (?) (Walters 48.2086.14).",
