    "Description": "Venus plays with her son, Cupid, the god of love.  The light-hearted affection and rounded, natural proportions of the figures are appealing qualities of northern European statuettes of this period, which were meant for intimate enjoyment.  This type of figure, especially the representation of Cupid as a baby with a rather large head, point to the mature style of Leonhard Kern, who produced lively statuettes in boxwood, ivory, and bronze, as well as monumental stone sculpture.",
