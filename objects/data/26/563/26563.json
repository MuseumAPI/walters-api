    "Description": "Onyx is often chosen for cameos because it frequently contains a straight, well-defined vein of white. The subject can be carved from the white vein, and the dark part is then removed from the visual field to create the image. Lions were common subjects for antique cameos. This beautifully carved piece could have been offered for sale as an antique or as a piece in which the art and techniques of antiquity were reflected. Few 17th-century collectors could have told the difference.",
