    "Description": "Four of these saints are recognizable by their attributes: Sebastian by his arrows, Anthony Abbot by his staff, Margaret by her dragon, and Lucy by her burning lamp. The fifth is a bishop, as indicated by his miter; his crozier is incised directly into the gold leaf above Anthony Abbot's head. While three of the saints face toward what would have been the altarpiece's main panel, two turn their gaze outward. By directing the gaze of selected figures towards the worshiper, the painter made the saints appear more attentive to the needs of those who looked to them for help and protection.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Zeri catalogue number 10, pp. 17-18.",
