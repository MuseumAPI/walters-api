    "Description": "The pin itself has broken off and all that remains is the elaborate pinhead: a scallop shell, an orb, and the bust of a woman. The hairstyle of the woman is that favored by Julia Domna, wife of the emperor Septimius Severus, and this is possibly a representation of the empress herself. Elaborate bone pins were common, their heads frequently in the form of miniature Aphrodites or female heads, as here.",
