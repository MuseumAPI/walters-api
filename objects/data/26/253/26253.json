    "Description": "This is a rare and unusual example if a three-dimensional mandala of the Jain goddess Padmavati, identified by a Devanagari inscription on the front base. The inscription is certainly a later addition by someone who was not familiar with the Kannada language of Karnataka. A comparison of stylistic features from the region (Pal 1994, nos. 67-69) suggests that the mandala is of Karnataka origin. Apart from the similar figural forms and modeling, the design of the throne back and the nimbus are especially distinctive of Karnataka.",
