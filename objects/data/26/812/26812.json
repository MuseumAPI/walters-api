    "Description": "Water pots for washing brushes of this form are named after their shape, either beehive or chicken-coop (domed bamboo baskets with a small opening on top for feeding chicks) washers. This washer has a wide round foot, a domed body, and a short, narrow, and gently curved neck for the small rounded opening on top. The peach bloom glaze is soft pink speckled with apple red and a small patch of green on the neck. Three medallions based on archaic designs are incised in the paste of the porcelain beneath the glaze and depict stylized dragons coiled among clouds.\r\n  \r\nThe finest of peach bloom wares date to the later half of the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), produced at the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. The glaze's delicate modulation of color suited its application on sets of petite porcelains for the scholar's writing table, including small flower vases, brush washers, and boxes for seal paste. The spotted red and green mottling is possible through a technique used in peach bloom glazes. A copper-oxide glaze is blown on to the vessel resulting in varied concentrations of copper that, when exposed during firing, oxidize to form green spots and modulation.\r\n",
