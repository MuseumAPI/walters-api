Makers of mosaic glass cut thin slices of from long, thin rods known as canes. The slices were placed side by side on a marble slab and heated in a furnace until they fused together. The soft flat disk of fused glass was then placed over a bowl-shaped form and heated until it slumped into the desired shape.",
