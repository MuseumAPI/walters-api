    "Description": "In western Europe during the 18th century, small boxes, ostensibly snuff containers, executed in gold and other precious materials, were among the most prized, luxury products.  In this example, the master goldsmith Jean George worked in several colors of gold, the differences being achieved by using different alloys, a technique known as quatre couleur.  The images on the six surfaces of the box recall the harbor scenes of the painter Joseph Vernet (1714-1789).",
