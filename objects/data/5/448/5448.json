    "Description": "This delicately carved pendant in a silver frame was worn on the chest by a bishop or abbot. Christ stands in the center flanked by John the Baptist on the left and a group of five angels on the right. Christ, John, and the first two angels are shown standing on snakes or dragons in an allusion to Psalm 73:13: \"You divided the sea by your might: you broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.\" The other side of the pendant contains a composition known as \"Deesis\", where the Virgin and John the Baptist flanks Christ and address to Him a prayer for the salvation of humankind.",
