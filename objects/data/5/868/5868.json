    "Description": "The image of the triumphant Christ is taken from Psalm 91: \"You will tread on the lion and the adder, the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.\" This and another panel, now in the British Museum, London, might once have been part of a large reliquary chasse made in the twelfth century to hold the remains of Saint Oda of Amay. When a new chasse for Saint Oda was made in the thirteenth century, these pieces of the older reliquary were not discarded, but refashioned into separate, smaller reliquaries. In fact, the now lost twelfth-century chasse itself was made with recycled materials: the figure of Christ triumphantly trampling the beasts seen on the Baltimore reliquary appears to be even older, perhaps taken and reused from an eleventh-century altar frontal.",
