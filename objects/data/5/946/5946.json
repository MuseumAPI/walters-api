    "Description": "This book of sermons in German and Latin was made in the second half of the fifteenth century. The parchment flyleaves, containing texts from Donatus' work on grammar, were written slightly earlier than the manuscript and used as pastedowns. The manuscript is exceptional for retaining its original binding of cuir-cisele (chiseled leather) over wood boards. The binding is of a type current in the Austrian Tyrol at this period. Also a note on fol. 133v refers to Bernhard von Gottesgnaden (or von Rohr), archbishop of Salzburg from 1466 to 1481. These pieces of evidence locate the collection of sermons in Salzburg. Although the manuscript is lacking in miniatures or decorated initials, red ink is used for initials and rubrics marking the beginning of each sermon.",
