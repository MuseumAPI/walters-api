    "Description": "During the winter of 1844/45, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau shared quarters with fellow painter Jules Dupr\u00e9 to the east of Paris, near l'\u00cesle-Adam on the Oise River. In this view showing the effects of frost on the sloping terrain, Rousseau broke with Academic practice by working outdoors for a week, painting directly on the canvas. In so doing, he bypassed the distinction between the outdoor sketch and the finished painting, which was traditionally completed in the studio.",
