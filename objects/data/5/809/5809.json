    "Description": "The faun (a creature of the woodlands in Greco-Roman mythology, identified by his horns and pointed ears) plays the cymbals and works a clapper with his right foot. Soldani made multiple versions in different sizes of this figure, a copy of a famous life-size ancient Hellenistic marble statue, which was already in the Uffizi gallery in Florence. This small size is perfect for a collector, as it can be easily picked up.\r\n\r\nThis statuette can be compared with the two groups by Soldani: \"Adonis Mourned by Venus and Cupids\" (Walters 54.677) and \"The Dead Christ Mourned by the Virgin and an Angel\" (Walters 54.1066). They all share an attention to the tactile qualities of the surface, but the others are complex pieces that demonstrate his artistic imagination and originality in composition. \r\n",
