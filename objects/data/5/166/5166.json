    "Description": "Egyptian faience is a composite material composed of ground quartz and natron (sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate).  Most faience is glazed in a vivid blue or green color; the polychrome faience seen here is much more complicated to produce.  \r\n\r\nThe duck was mold-made together with the remains of its ring handle on the bird's left side. The surface of the body displays a raised dot pattern, while the end of the wings have a feather pattern. The form may have been inspired by the red-figure duck vases of Etruria and south Italy. The duck is depicted with such detailed naturalism that the underside even has delicately modeled webbed feet.",
