    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts a scene from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Having saved Lot and his family from the Sodomites, the angels instructed him to flee the city with his wife and two daughters, because the angels were about to destroy it. Lot lingered, so they took his hand, and those of his family, and placed them outside the city, and instructed them to flee to the small city of Zoar, without looking back. However, Lot's wife disobeyed, and upon looking back she was turned into a pillar of salt.",
