    "Description": "This small white porcelain covered box is decorated with underglaze cobalt blue painting and colored overglaze enamels in shades of green, light green, red, yellow, mustard and brown. At the center is a seated sage resting his chin upon his hands, which are crossed over one another on a raised left knee. The serene and smiling figure resides in the shade of bamboo and is surrounded by a border of bright technicolor blossoms. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain. During the Transitional period between the Ming and Qing dynasties, due to lack of imperial stability, porcelain production became focused on private patrons and European or Japanese markets. Private kilns replaced the Imperial kilns as forerunners of the blue and white wares from the span of 1620 to 1683. \r\n",
