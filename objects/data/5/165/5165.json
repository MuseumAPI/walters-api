    "Description": "Nattier was regarded as one of the foremost portrait painters at the court of Louis XV (reigned 1715-1774). He occasionally turned to miniature painting, as demonstrated by this likeness of Cassini de Thury (1714-1784), a distinguished astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, shown seated at his desk taking a pinch of snuff from a gold box.\r\n\r\nThe composition for this miniature was taken from an oil painting dating from 1745 of Duval de l'Epinoy by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour (Private Collection). Only the face has been altered. Recently both the 19th-century identification of the sitter and the attribution to Nattier have been questioned.",
