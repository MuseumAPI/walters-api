    "Description": "A fishing village is being lashed by a violent gale. The fisherman's wives struggle across the dunes to mount an old fortification at the left. Beyond are an Argand lighthouse and the village houses with red tile roofs glistening in a shaft of light that has pierced the glowering sky. Several men struggle to raise a blue and white signal flag at a post near the sea's edge.\r\n\r\nThe former identification of the site as the coast at the village of Scheveningen, near The Hague, cannot be substantiated. The presence of a lighthouse in close proximity to houses did not occur at Scheveningen nor elsewhere, given the danger of fire.",
