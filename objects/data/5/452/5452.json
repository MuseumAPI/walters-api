    "Description": "Puget's marble version (9-feet-high, now in the Louvre, Paris), completed in 1682, was made for Louis XIV's gardens at Versailles. In 1688 a contract was signed for a smaller bronze reproduction.\r\n\t\r\nThe Greek athlete Milo was famous for his strength, but once when he tried to tear a tree apart, his hand got stuck, and he was devoured by wild animals.\r\n\t\r\nIf this composition had been designed to be cast in bronze, Puget would surely not have introduced the drapery which served as a structural support in the marble. This bronze was cast in parts (note the seams on Milo's thighs) and meticulously tooled with a punch in the mane and in Milo's beard.",
