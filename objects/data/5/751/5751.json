    "Description": "The Christ Child touches his mother's chin with a gesture of affection that was probably inspired by 15th-century Italian paintings then greatly admired at the Ethiopian royal court. Victorious saints on horseback had great appeal for the upper classes of Ethiopia, where noblemen were trained in horsemanship and combat. The artist is most likely a follower of Fre Seyon, the celebrated 15th-century painter who left only one signed work.",
