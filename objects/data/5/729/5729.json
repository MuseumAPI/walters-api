    "Description": "This painting of a female saint may also be a portrait. A noblewoman of Bologna might have commissioned Amico Aspertini to paint her as a saint as an expression of religious fervor and of the ideal of holiness to which she aspired. The saint poses in a contemporary, Renaissance costume, her hair covered by a veil and a net. She holds a book in imitation of the Virgin Mary, who is often depicted with a book.\r\n\r\nAspertini was known for his eccentric style, which is seen here in the odd shape of the face and the large hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please seeFederico  Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 254, pp. 376-377.\r\n",
