    "Description": "The Virgin kneels on a crescent moon with her hands in an attitude of prayer. Her head is uncovered, and her hair falls down her back and in tresses over her shoulders. In rendering the folds of the garments, little concession has been made to anatomy.\r\nThis piece, like 71.342, was apparently carved in the Portuguese colony of Goa, on the west coast of the Indian subcontinent by a native artist.. \r\n\r\nA square paper label with blue borders on the under surface of the statuette is inscribed in ink: \"123.\"",
