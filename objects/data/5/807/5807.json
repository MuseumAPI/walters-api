    "Description": "The artist has created an idealized image of a beautiful young woman with jewelry and long flowing hair. She is surrounded by a scroll that translates: \"As long as I live, I will love you, and after your death my one humble desire is to be united with you. I am left at your mercy.\" Such a melancholic and stylized declaration of love was characteristic of courtly society and speaks of the power of beauty to enamor the beholder.\r\n\r\nPainted in cobalt blue and gold-colored luster, the plate utilizes the color scheme that Italian painters of maiolica knew from Hispano-Moresque earthenware.\r\n",
