    "Description": "This damaged plaque depicts St. Francis receiving the stigmata. It is painted in gold and ruby lustre, and in blue, copper-green, yellow, ochre, black and opaque white. The main surface is scraped down leaving a raised frame. At the entrance of a cave, St. Francis, turned three-quarters right, kneels on his right knee receiving rays from a crucified seraph. At the right, on the opposite bank of a stream, a monk drowses against a rock, a book lying open on the ground beside him. In the background is a castle with turrets rising from a lake on which are two boatmen. The back is unglazed.\r\n",
