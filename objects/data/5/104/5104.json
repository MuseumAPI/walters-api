    "Description": "This sketch depicts a king wearing the \"blue crown,\" a collar, and two strings of gold beads. His stubble beard is a sign of mourning. The features of the king make it likely that Seti I is represented. The elaborate execution of the royal image, which is without doubt the work of a master painter, differs from the depiction of the two hands. This sketch was probably a model for trainees, and was later reused for other training purposes by an experienced artist. It is interesting that the painter of the royal head has chosen the topic of a stubble-bearded king, which was not part of the official motifs.",
