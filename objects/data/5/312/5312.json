He also became a professor of painting at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1863. This painting replicates a once-lost official portrait commissioned in 1865 for the apartments of Empress Eug\u00e9nie in the Tuileries Palace. Scoffing critics of Napoleon III's regime dismissed the original work as \"a portrait of a hotel manager.\" \r\n\r\nIn 2009, the full-length portrait was rediscovered in storage at the chateau of Compiegne.",
