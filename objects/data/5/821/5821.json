This piece also has a lotus-petal pedestal that curves up at the edges.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha's broad and round face may  have antecedents in local sculptures. If there was an outside influence that contributed a liberating atmosphere and made possible these varied combinations of facial elements, perhaps it was some knwledge either of the Mon styles of lower Burma or of the sculpture of Ming Dynasty China.",
