    "Description": "The biblical book of Daniel tells of Susanna, a married woman who is spied upon by two old judges while bathing in her garden. They attempt to force themselves upon her, saying that if she does not submit, they will accuse her of adultery. With Daniel's assistance, Susanna's innocence is established, and the two elders are put to death.\r\n\r\nThis painting depicts the unhappy woman as she tries to escape the advances and gazes of the men. The focus on her body testifies to her innocence and virtue, as truth was often symbolized by a nude woman, but was also meant to appeal to male patrons. The soft, luminous coloring is characteristic of the late Roman baroque style.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 334, pp. 459-460.",
