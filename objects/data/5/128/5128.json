    "Description": "The subject, a bewigged young man, is shown bust-length, in three-quarter view, wearing a cravat, buttoned coat, and mantle. \r\n\r\nInscribed on the bottom side of the bust is: \"And. Pozzi F.c,\" and below: \"C. H. W. Roma 1755.\"\r\n\r\nThe initials C. H. W. were formerly identified as those of the British diplomat and satirical writer Sir Charles Hanbury Williams (1708-1759). However, the ivory image bears little resemblance to the known portraits of Williams, who was serving in St. Petersburg at the time the sculpture was made.\r\n\r\nAndrea Pozzi (Pozzo) was an ivory carver who worked for Charles III of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe reverse bears a paper sticker: IVORY MEDALLION, PORTRAIT OF / SIR CHARLES HANBURY WILLIAMS / :1709-1759: / SIGNED,: AND. POZZI FE, ROMA 1755.; another oval paper sticker is inscribed \"5.\"",
