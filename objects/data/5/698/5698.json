    "Description": "This jar painted in underglaze cobalt blue depicts three bounding lions among the waving tassels of brocaded balls. Lions are Buddhist guardians and are often portrayed as they are here playing with a ball or ribbons. The jar has a bulbous body with high shoulders, waisted sides, and spread foot. Its neck is decorated with varied Buddhist and Taoist emblems wrapped with fillets. The Conch is one of eight Buddhist Emblems, the Artemisia Leaf and the Pair of Books are two of the Eight Buddhist Treasures, and the kuai ban (bamboo or bone clappers) is a Taoist emblem of the Immortal and patron of actors Cao Guo Jiu. Buddhist and Taoist imagery could often be combined on one vessel, and indication that the two religions were practiced together. The lid of the jar, with flared rim and radish shaped knob, is painted with cranes amid scrolling clouds. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. The ornate decoration of this jar reveals the skillful application of varied shades of blue as well as the creative textures captured through the curly mains and fluffy tufts of fur on the lions. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. \r\n",
