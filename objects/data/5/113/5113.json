    "Description": "One of the main duties of the Egyptian king was to perform rituals for the gods. There are many representations which show him either standing or kneeling with offerings in his hands, or in a gesture of adoration. This kneeling king is dressed in the royal Nemes headdress, a royal kilt, and an elaborate collar. The figure has lost the inserted cobra serpent above the forehead, the arms, and the offerings in his hands.",
