    "Description": "The soft-paste porcelain of this vase is painted and incised with two foliated panels on a faintly crackled ground. Inside one panel, a lion is seated with head facing towards a pine tree that provides the beast shade. Mossy rock formations also appear in the panels.  The panel on the opposite side is filled with a second lion standing beside more mossy rock and lingzhi, a sacred fungus symbolic of immortality. Bats, symbols of happiness, fly above each lion. The surrounding ground of fish roe pattern is filled with white flower sprays, butterflies, and bats that are molded in the paste of the porcelain. Along the lip of the vase is a band of octagons filled with dotted circles. The vase has straight sides that tapper towards a round flat foot and slanted shoulders that hold a short wide neck. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
