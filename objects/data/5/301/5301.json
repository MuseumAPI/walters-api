    "Description": "A narrative panel from an altarpiece devoted to Saint Francis, this image combines the funeral of the saint (died 1226) with his canonization by Pope Gregory IX in 1228. The saint's body lies on a bier surrounded by a mourning crowd. The laymen include fashionably dressed young men, along with the lame and blind who seek a miraculous cure by touching the saint's dead body. To the right, the seated pope writes the decree of canonization. The careful attention to fashion, vivid colors, and animated expressions are characteristic of the International Gothic style.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 97, pp. 151-154.",
