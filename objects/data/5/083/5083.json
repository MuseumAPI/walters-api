    "Description": "IIn the New Testament, Mary from the town of Magdala was one of Christ's most loyal followers. Later tradition associated her with a reformed prostitute. The merging of these identities produced emotionally powerful images of a remorseful yet alluring young woman, meditating on death. A related painting is on the wall nearby. Many people kept skulls for meditational purposes, as you can see in the Collector's Study (off the Sculpture Court on Level 2A of this building).\r\nSpadarino is one of several painters in Rome in the early 1600s who explored dramatic, compact compositions of a few figures in a dark space illuminated by a strong light, much like a modern \"spotlight,\" an approach made famous by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571\u20131610).",
