    "Description": "Decorating this casket are ten scenes from Genesis and two from the life of Christ. On the front of the lid are Abraham's preparations for the sacrifice of his son Isaac, ordered by God, and the Resurrected Christ. The Old Testament events were interpreted as prefigurations or prototypes of those in the New: Abraham's readiness to sacrifice his son prefigured God's sacrifice of his son. However, the connection between the other pairs is not as clear; it is possible that the casket maker (a different craftsman and shop) paid little attention to the order requested by the enamellist. The false hinges on the front of the casket are also odd, but a virtually identical casket documented in the collections of the dukes of Saxony by the early 17th century supports the authenticity of this one.\r\n\r\nThe overall decorative effect-relying on translucent enamels in deep garnet red, blues, and an ocher created by using a clear enamel that allows the natural color of the copper to come through is quite appealing.",
