    "Description": "Madrazo reached the pinnacle of his success at the 1878 Exposition Universelle, where he was proclaimed the successor to his brother-in-law Mariano Fortuny as the foremost contemporary Spanish painter. In this work, he displays his dramatic sense of color, mastery of atmospheric effects, and technical skill. He imparts variety to the scene by contrasting various social classes ranging from the seated blind beggar woman to the fashionably attired ladies descending the church steps.\r\n",
