In the background, the hazy outline of the Howth peninsula stretches across the horizon, Dublin's pier bisects the estuary, and the manmade harbor of Dun Laoghaire, then known as Kingstown, is visible through the wildflowers at the base of the slope in the foreground. Nicholl was a self-taught artist who specialized in topographical views.",
