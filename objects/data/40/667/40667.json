    "Description": "This plaque is part of a series whose designs were based upon the woodcut illustrations of an edition of Virgil, \"Opera,\" edited by Sebastian Brant and printed by Johann Gr\u00fcninger in Strasbourg, September 9, 1502 (22nd illustration, fol. 178). The same cuts appeared in an edition issued at Lyons in 1517 by Sacon.\r\n\r\nThe plaque depicts a scene from the \"Aeneid,\" (IV, vv. 651-654). On the right Anchises is seated before a German half-timbered manor with overhanging bays. Aeneas points the way to safety to his family, Cre\u00fcsa, Ascanius, and a maid. On the ground at the left, lie the corpse of Polites and the beheaded body of Priam. The city of Troy is ablaze in the background.",
