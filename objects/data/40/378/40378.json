    "Description": "Rousseau was an innovative ceramist and glass designer who played a pivotal role in introducing Japanese motifs into French decorative arts. At the 1884 Paris Union Centrale exhibition, he first exhibited \"crackle\" glass, which was created using a 16th-century Venetian technique in which the glass is immersed in cold water between firings. The actual production of the glass was carried out by Appert Fr\u00e8res, a glass manufactory in the Paris suburb of Clichy.",
