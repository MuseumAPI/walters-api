    "Description": "Batoni was particularly famous for his portraits and had many elite clients, such as Cardinal Prospero Colonna di Sciarra (1708-65), who was a member of a great Roman noble family. The cardinal can be identified by the letter he holds, which is addressed to him. The red color of the clothing of his ecclesiastic office produces an imposing effect against the dark background. Batoni's virtuosity in the handling of paint comes through in the meticulous depiction of different textures, such as hair, silk, and lace.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 415, pp. 526-527.",
