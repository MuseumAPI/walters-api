    "Description": "To manufacture this figurine, an artisan took two small clay coils and pressed them together. The simple details of the body contrast with the often elaborate hairstyles. The female figurines are most often found in middens (trash deposits), usually broken in several pieces. Their relative frequency and simple manufacture suggests that they may have been used in fertility rituals and then discarded. Male figures, distinguishable from the females by the presence of a small bulge at the groin, are relatively rare.",
