    "Description": "Henrietta Maria (1609-1669) was the French-born queen of England and wife of King Charles I.  The most famous life-size portraits of her are by the great Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck whose elegant style influenced English portraitists, including those like Hoskins who specialized in miniatures.  In contrast to earlier English portrait miniatures, this one includes the kind of landscape detail that Van Dyck often included.",
