    "Description": "In his late career, Corot regularly painted \"souvenirs\" or memories of sites that he had visited earlier in his life. Around thirty (or one-fifth) of his exhibited works during the last twenty years of his life included the word \"souvenir\" in the title. Here, the artist represents the bridge and 12th-century church of this small village about seven miles from Fontainebleau. The silvery light is suggestive of the filtering of an image through memory.",
