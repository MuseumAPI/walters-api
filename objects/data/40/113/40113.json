    "Description": "Standing at the right side of the tsuba is Nitta Yoshisada (1301-1338). He was a warrior loyal to Emperor Go-Daigo (1288-1339) in the emperor's war against the Kamakura shogunate. Yoshisada led an army to attack Kamakura in 1333. Because the terrain around Kamakura is very rough, he decided to attack by sea. Here, he is shown throwing his sword into the sea as an offering after praying to the gods of the sea. His attack was successful and Emperor Go-Daigo returned to power. On the reverse of the tsuba is a pine tree. This is part of a mounted set depicting warriors loyal to Emperor Go-Daigo.",
