    "Description": "The center of this plate is painted in underglaze cobalt blue depicting blossomed peonies on branches inside of a double ring. The border of the plate is sculpted and embellished with painted wide pointed petals and contains thin sprigs of a variety of flowers, including bell shaped flowers and prunus branches. The outer rim is painted with three prominent branches of peony as well. Outline and wash technique is utilized in applying varied shades of cobalt blue pigment and creates subtle variegation to the petals of each flower type. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. While Persian cobalt produces more vibrant blues, it had a tendency to run and pile on the surface because of its high iron content. On the other hand, domestic cobalt rich in magnesium was easier to manipulate and varied in shade. Domestic ore often lacked the potency of Persian cobalt so the two could be mixed. \r\n",
