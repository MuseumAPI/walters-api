    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.562 is an illuminated fragment of the Qur'an that contains chapter 78 (Surat al-naba') through chapter 114 (Surat al-nas). It dates to the 9th century AH/AD 15th and was probably produced in Iran. The text is written in a large vocalized Muhaqqaq script in black ink. The chapter headings are inscribed in both the New Abbasid (Broken Cursive) style and Thuluth script. Verse markers are illuminated in gold, and polychrome medallions mark 10th verses. The black goatskin binding, which is attributable to the 11th century AH/AD 17th, has a blind-tooled central lobed oval with floral motifs and pastedowns of marbled paper.",
