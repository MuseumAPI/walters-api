    "Description": "Remnants of Napoleon's Grand Army retreating from Moscow in the winter of 1812-13 have bivouacked around a ruined church. The foreground in cluttered with debris and huddled figures. Discernible are grenadiers of the Garde Imperiale and members of the regular forces. A tonsured monk is praying at the base of a religious image exposed on the building's wall. In the background French soldiers ward off the attacking Cossacks. Ominously hovering overhead in the leaden skies are flocks of vultures.",
