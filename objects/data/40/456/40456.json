    "Description": "Three angels hold a cloth of honor behind the Virgin and two others swing censers at the sides while she is crowned. The scene is placed beneath a canopy of three trefoil arches.\r\n\r\nThe panel is recessed on the reverse to receive wax for writing. It was attached to other panels with two holes in the right side for cords, and a hole in the center of the left side for securing the other tablet or tablets.\r\n\r\nAlthough wax tablet covers are usually decorated with secular scenes, a number of others exist with religious subjects which suggests that wax notebooks were used by the clergy as well as the laity.",
