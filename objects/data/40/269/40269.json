    "Description": "The Virgin, turned three-quarters towards the left, is seen half-length behind a ledge on which the Child is seated. She is suckling the infant Christ. Her veil is blue with a gilt border. The background is of a lighter blue, inscribed in gilt letters: REGINA CELI SALVE AVE. Her nimbus is of a buff color, as is the halo and hair of the Child, enhanced with gilding. Her bodice is white, with a scroll-design painted in brownish-red. Her dress is purple, highlighted and decorated with scrolls in gold, the sleeves turquoise-blue with highlights in white. The garment of the Child is light green. The ledge on which he sits is a mottled blue.  \r\n\r\nThe design and the technical details of the dress ornaments, delineated in red on opaque white or applied in gold on translucent enamel, are related to pieces produced in the workshop of L\u00e9onard Limosin.",
