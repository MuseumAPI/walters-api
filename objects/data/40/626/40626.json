    "Description": "The ancient Greeks conceived of their messenger gods-divinities who carried messages to other gods or humans-as winged, alluding to their swiftness and their ability to go anywhere. Iris and Hermes were the main messenger gods in Greek mythology; Iris primarily served Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods. This small oil container bears a rare representation of both messengers together.",
