    "Description": "Arm from a small statue, probably of a boy. The arm was raised nearly to shoulder level while the hand held something about which the fingers curled lightly, perhaps the rein of a chariot. The modeling is very fine. \r\n\r\nJust below the shoulder, near the broken edge, there is a solid cross section of bronze. Either a core is concealed or the arm is solid; the great weight proves that it is not hollow cast and empty.",
