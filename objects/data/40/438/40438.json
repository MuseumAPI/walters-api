    "Description": "This double-sided painting is a standard intended to be carried during processions and other religious ceremonies. It was probably made for a brotherhood devoted to Saint Michael located in a town in Marche. On one side is the Crucifixion with the mourning Virgin and Saint John. On the reverse, Saint Michael tramples the devil and holds the scales in which he weighs a blessed soul; kneeling at his feet are members of the brotherhood, clad in white habits with cowls as is usual in the orders of flagellants (people who whip themselves to show penitence).\r\n\r\nFor more information on this standard, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 127, pp. 193-194.",
