    "Description": "This form of desk with its counter-weighted receding top became fashionable in 1760, when a similar desk was commissioned for Louis XV.  This example is attributed to Teun\u00e9, a specialist in such desks who became a master \"\u00e9b\u00e9niste\" (cabinetmaker) in 1766.\r\n\r\nPortrayed in the marquetry of the top is a perspective of the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint Maur, a residence of the prince of Cond\u00e9.  The ch\u00e2teau, situated in what is now St. Maur-les-Fosses, was demolished during the French Revolution.\r\n",
