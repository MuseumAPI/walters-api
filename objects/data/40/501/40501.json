    "Description": "The Venetian artist Niccol\u00f2 Brancaleon worked in the Ethiopian imperial court at the turn of the 16th century. Brancaleon's use of naturalistic facial features and emphasis on three-dimensional volumes reveal his Italian background. However, his use of flat bands of bright colors in the frame and background testify to his knowledge of Ethiopian artistic conventions. Like Fre Seyon, an Ethiopian painter and monk active at the end of the fifteenth century, the Italian artist developed a highly influential artistic style.",
