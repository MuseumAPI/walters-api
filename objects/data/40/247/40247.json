    "Description": "The Roman general Scipio Africanus, identified by his baton of command, leads his troops to victory over the Carthaginians. The enamelist Pierre Nouailher, who signed this piece, took his composition from a combination of Italian and French prints, ultimately derived from drawings by followers of Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe enamel work here shows that fine work continued to be carried out in Limoges far into the 17th century. While the style of the interior composition in \"grisaille\" continues earlier traditions, the beautiful floral patterns on the exterior are prompted by the same visual impulses as the enameled watches from this period.",
