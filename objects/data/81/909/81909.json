    "Description": "The Princess Matsi is seen dancing for the prince and their two children. After the prince gave the white elephant to the Brahmins he was exiled and asked that Princess Matsi remain in the city; she refused and said that she would burn herself if not allowed to accompany the prince. He relented and she is seen dancing in her happiness being with him and the children.\r\n\r\nThe painting is believed to be from the early part of the reign of Rama V (1868-1910). The figures are in royal dress, typical of Rattankosin art. The scene takes place in an semi-surreal impressionistic landscape setting; a wooded glen, with defined mountains across a sloping  plain. Because of differences in technique, the figures seem not to be part of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe painting is rare in that this theme is seldom portrayed.",
