    "Description": "This folio from Walters manuscript W.552 is executed in Kufic script. Already in the 9th century, the rectilinear Kufic script seen on this page began to be replaced by a more cursive \"font\" called the New Abbasid style. The Abbasids were an early Islamic dynasty that ruled from AD 750-1258.  The first center of political, economic and cultural life for the Abbasids was Baghdad, the circular City of Peace (madinat al-salam), which became the empire's capital in 762.",
