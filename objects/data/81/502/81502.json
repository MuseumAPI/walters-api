    "Description": "This Gospel book was copied by Mik'ayel, one of the foremost scribes of his time, and donated to the church of St. Stephen in memory of a prince, Khan Sultan. The text is written on paper, a medium that was becoming more common during this period, in a script known as bolorgir (Armenian minuscule). A portrait of St. Matthew introduces the text of his Gospel. A winged man, Matthew's symbol, appears before the Evangelist as if to inspire his writing.",
