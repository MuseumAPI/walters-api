    "Description": "In this charming image, a young boy has climbed a tree and is swinging from one of its limbs. This is an extremely rare depiction, and it has nothing to do with the text it accompanies (Psalm 5, a reading for the dead) but is simply an opportunity for the artist to have fun. The small size of the tree in comparison with the child focuses our attention on his antics, inviting us to imagine ourselves as carefree.",
