    "Description": "These ornaments were part of a woman's headpiece. The triangular pieces are cast and have one top and four bottom loops, which are soldered on. The front design consists of three small circles on the right and left side; a bead-molded separation line and similar borders frame the motif. Six long chains hang down from this pendant (sequence: 2-1-1-2). The small, flat dangles at the lower end of the chains represent small hands.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the sister pendant is a stamp in Arabic with the name of the ruler and the date: al-Mansur 1215. Al-Mansur Ali I ruled from AH 1189 to 1224 (AD 1775-1809); he was the son of Al-Mahdi al-\"Abbas and belonged to the Qasimid family.\r\n\r\nOn the back of this pendant is an engraving in Hebrew with the name of the Jewish silversmith: S(alim) S(alim) Habshush.",
