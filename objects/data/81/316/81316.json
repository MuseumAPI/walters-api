    "Description": "The song \"Ring-around-a-Rosy\" is still popular today, often danced in a circle just as we see the monkeys doing here. Yet this seemingly lighthearted song has a dark past. The plague swept Europe during the 14th century, and the song's words actually refer to its terrible symptoms: a circular rose-colored rash, sneezing or coughing, and finally, death. Flower petals were worn in a pouch around the neck to keep the smell of death away. The song, then, seems very different in this context.\r\n\r\nRing-a ring-o-rosies\r\nA pocket full of posies\r\nAchoo, Achoo,\r\nWe all fall down.",
