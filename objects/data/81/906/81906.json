    "Description": "An illustration from the Jataka story of Prince Vessantara. The painting is believed to be from the early part of the reign of Rama V (1868-1910). This Jataka tells of the Prince's selfless generosity. In this painting Sakka appears overhead while simultaneously appearing to the Prince as Jujok, a Brahmin, to ask for his wife as a slave. The Prince consents, and as a reward for such generosity, Sakka grants him eight wishes.\r\n\r\nThe scene takes place in front of two salas (pavilions) which emulate Thai temple architecture. The background setting: the muted black and gray impressionistic landscape indicates the Chinese influence on painting at that time and contrasts with the bright polychrome foreground. The figures of Prince Vessantara and Princess Matsi are dressed and crowned in royal attire, typical of depictions of Rattankosin and earlier periods of Thai art. The Sakka (and his alter self - the Brahmin), as customary, are depicted in green.",
