    "Description": "Hidden within a jungle of flowering vines, an ape attempts to unlock the secret to a three-dimensional puzzle. Medieval artists were fond of depicting animals, in particular apes and monkeys, engaged in human activities. In medieval Europe, the term \"aping\" was used to describe the mimicking of human nature, so showing apes acting like people was a play on this idea.",
