    "Description": "In this painting the Buddha stands with his two main disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana. The two disciples were early followers of the Buddha and are known for their great piousness and power. They are frequently depicted flanking the Buddha and honoring him by putting their hands up in a gesture of deference or respect. Two celestial hermits also pay homage at the top of the painting. This subject was popular in Thai painting in the 19th century.",
