The colophon indicates that it was completed on 5 Shawwal 976 AH/AD 1569. The manuscript opens with a double-page illuminated frontispiece, and there are 8 paintings illustrating the text in a style that has been associated with the school of painting at Shiraz. The dark brown/black leather binding, which is contemporary with the manuscript, has a large central panel with oval and pendants. The border is comprised of cartouches alternating with roundels. All are gold-brushed and decorated with floral and cloud motifs.",
