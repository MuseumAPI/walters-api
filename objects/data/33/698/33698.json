In this painting Siddons is shown almost in profile with an up-turned gaze. Better known as Mrs. Siddons, she was a great tragic actress, best known for her portrayal of Lady Macbeth.\r\nThe back of the miniature contains a piece of hair and a monogram in seed pearl, \"H.S.\" or possibly \"H.C.S..\"\r\n",
