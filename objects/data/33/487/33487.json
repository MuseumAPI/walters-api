    "Description": "Saint John the Baptist was Christ's greatest prophet. He lived in the desert clad in a camel's skin, eating locusts and wild honey, and preaching repentance.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary detail and meticulous technique in this small work reflect Giovanni's primary occupation as a manuscript illuminator. Indeed, this work is painted on parchment. The town in the background may represent Vicenza. Strange figures appear in the clouds. Images of saints in the wilderness (which can be seen in this area) gave Renaissance artists the opportunity of depicting landscapes, which showed their interest in representing the real world.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 143, pp. 214-215.",
