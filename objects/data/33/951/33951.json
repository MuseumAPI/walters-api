    "Description": "This illuminated folio is part of the prefatory image cycle of a Flemish Psalter. It shows the scene of the Crucifixion\r\n\r\nThe Psalter was created in French Flanders for a lady with Cistercian connections in the third quarter of the thirteenth century. Fourteenth-century additions for the use of a woman suggest that it continued to be used by female supplicants for some time after its creation. A prefatory cycle of ten full-page miniatures was also added in the fourteenth century, which complemented the original, and more traditional, series of ten historiated initials found within the Psalter.",
