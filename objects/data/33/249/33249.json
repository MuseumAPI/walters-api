    "Description": "This plate is one of a few rare dated ceramics from the Timurid period. Scientific testing of its fabric demonstrates that it came from Nishapur, a town in northeastern Iran that flourished as a ceramic-manufacturing center in the 9th-12th centuries and that is now recognized-partly on the basis of the evidence provided by our plate-to have remained active in pottery production during subsequent periods.",
