Set forth on the table are the Paschal Lamb and numerous utensils, and two wine-ewers stand on the tessellated floor. A dog gnaws on a bone in the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe source was the engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi known to the French cataloguers under the improper name of \"C\u00e8ne aux pieds,\" because the feet show beneath the table cloth.",
