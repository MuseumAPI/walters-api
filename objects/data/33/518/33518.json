    "Description": "The Nazca culture of the southern coast of Peru produced many bright textiles and polychrome ceramics. They are best known for their huge land drawings, called geoglyphs, which can be seen properly only from the air. Large quantities of ceramics such as this have been found buried where important lines of the geoglyphs intersect. These were probably intended as offerings to the gods who controlled the weather. Most ceramic decoration reflects the Nazca view of their relationship with the natural environment and the important of water to their existence.",
