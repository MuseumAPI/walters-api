    "Description": "This small bottle shaped vase is painted in underglaze cobalt blue on a white porcelain body. Depicted on the body is a lion with dragon-like qualities.  Tufts of hair akin to flames rise from the shoulders and hips, tinted with copper red underglaze. Red rings also appear around the creature's eyes. The lion is depicted scratching at a pine tree with its front paw while a bat, a symbol for happiness, flies overhead. Subdued blue tones are applied in thin lines, exemplified in the thickly woven pattern of the pine needles, the swaying blades of grass, and the lively mane of the lion. The vase has a globular body from which a tall straight neck ascends. Crackling of the glaze is visible on the white body.\r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.  \r\n",
