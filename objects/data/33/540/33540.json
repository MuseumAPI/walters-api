He wears the black habit of the Benedictine order. The background is bright blue with a white line border. The enamel framework is of octagonal shape, the upper part suggesting the mask of a dragon, its wings entwined with drapery; on the lower edge, between the mitre and crozier of an abbot, a coat of arms: argent, a mount of ten peaks, in chief three billets or, one and two. In the spandrels, gilt foliage with flowers in blue, purple and green, over paillettes of foil.",
