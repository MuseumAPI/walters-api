    "Description": "Walters leaf W.675 is a single leaf from a dispersed manuscript (Aya Sofya 3703, later Top Kapi Seray 2147) of the Arabic version of De materia medica by Dioscorides (active ca. 65) that was copied in 621 AH/AD 1224 in Baghdad. Approximately 30 illustrations were removed from this parent manuscript that are now in public and private collections. The Walters' leaf depicts two doctors preparing medicine. A funnel is set on a tripod over a vessel. The two men preparing the medicinal draught stand on either side of the tripod beside two fruit trees. The text is written in partially vocalized Naskh script in brownish-black and red ink.",
