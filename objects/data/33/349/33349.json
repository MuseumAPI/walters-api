    "Description": "Pendants were worn by men around the neck on ceremonial occasions.  Columbus noted that the inhabitants of Panama who came to greet him wore gold pendants.  This piece could have been created in Columbus's time or during the previous 600 years.\r\n\r\nThis figure represents a jaguar, with which a warrior wanted to associate.  Two animals are frequently combined, creating a mythic creature with composite attributes, and animals may have two heads.  This jaguar holds one double-headed snake in his forepaws and mouth, and another in his hind paws.  Loops for suspension are under the forepaws.\r\n",
