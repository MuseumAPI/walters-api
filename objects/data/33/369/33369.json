    "Description": "Christ raises his right hand in benediction. In the right corner, part of a globe is visible, indicating his role as \"Salvator Mundi\" (Latin meaning \"savior of the world\"). His mild yet firm gaze encompasses all.\r\n\r\nSassoferrato specialized in devotional subjects. He chose pure colors and regular forms with emphasized contours that follow earlier traditions of religious painting. In addition, this image of Christ is based on a popular type in 16th-century northern art often combined with one of a praying Virgin Mary, representing them as king and queen of heaven.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 322, p. 450.",
