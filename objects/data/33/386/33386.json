    "Description": "This folio from Walters manuscript W.106 is the first image in a series of Bible pictures. The artist William de Brailes tells the Genesis story, condensing two days of Creation into one image. On the first day of Creation, God created heaven and earth, and the earth was without form and void. The Spirit of God moved across the face of the waters, and we see God himself gesturing to the Spirit with his right hand. God raises his left hand to the waters above him, which he separated from the firmament, beneath his feet, on the second day.",
