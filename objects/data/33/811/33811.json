    "Description": "The Roman sun-god Sol drives a chariot drawn by two winged horses through a dark sky studded with gold stars. The plate is from a series decorated with mythological representations of the planets. The composition is based on an engraving of 1542 by Aeneas Vico (1523-67), but De Court shows his own subtle sense of design in the strapwork (the pattern that looks like interwoven straps) around the edge.",
