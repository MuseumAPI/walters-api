    "Description": "This Book of Hours was created in Zwolle, Netherlands, ca. 1470. It belongs to the group of Sarijs manuscripts, which was named after the erroneous citation in most works that identifies the manuscripts as belonging to the same group of Sarijs instead of Marijs on January 19 of their calendars (also found in W. 918). In a study of this group by Lydia Wierda, the author suggests that these manuscripts were copied by students at the school of the Brethren of the Common Life in Zwolle and also decorated and illustrated in that city (although possibly by professional illuminators) during the period ca. 1470-90 (see Wierda, De Sarijs-handschriften). All of the principal decorative schemes and motifs in W.918, as well as the compositions of its miniatures, have close counterparts in other manuscripts belonging to the group.",
