    "Description": "George Stillman Hillard wrote of Lake Albano in \"Six Months in Italy,\" Boston, 1856, p. 403:\r\n\r\n\"This lake is one of the most beautiful sheets of water in Italy or anywhere else. It is about six miles in circumference and fills up the crater of an extinguished volcano. Its form is nearly circular and its outline as symmetrical as if shaped by the hand of art...A landscape painter might study here to great advantage to important elements of his art- the character of foliage, and the effects of shadows upon water.\"\r\n\r\nPastina has observed these features in this small, oval painting of the scenic view. \r\n\r\nThe spandrels created by the oval format on the rectangular canvas have been painted gold.",
