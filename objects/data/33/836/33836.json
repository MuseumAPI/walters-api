    "Description": "Rousseau was born in Cairo in 1875 and trained with Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me in Paris. In 1902, the year that he exhibited this painting at the salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais, he won the second class medal and a scholarship for travel abroad. His works, recording France's colonial territories, are represented in French museums, including the Louvre. In this view of the Atlas Mountains seen at dawn, the artist has admirably captured the appearance of the light hitting the range.",
