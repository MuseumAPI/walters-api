    "Description": "This is one of a pair (with Walters 57.621) of heavy armlets of solid silver tapering towards the ends which are shaped like nail heads and decorated by incised lines. The inside diameter of the pieces suggests that they were worn on the upper arm. The bracelets, one broken in two, were so heavily covered with corrosion, that they were originally classified as bronze. A similar pair of armlets, made of gold, was excavated in 1922 in the ancient E-nun-mah Temple at Ur under a floor of the Persian period (6th century BC). This hoard contained objects from as far back as the late 3rd millennium BC. Therefore it cannot provide a certain date for the bracelets.",
