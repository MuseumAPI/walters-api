    "Description": "This saucer shaped plate is decorated in underglaze cobalt blue on white porcelain. In the center a dragon emerges from the waves with flames on its shoulders and flanks as two fish (one a carp) swim in the spiraling waves. What may be depicted in this scene is the metamorphosis of the \"Fish Dragon\", an allegory for a scholar's success at the state competitive examinations. Curled crests of waves dotted with foam encircle the border of the plate while the underside is ornamented with six emblems tied with fillets \u2013 they include a couple of books, a round jewel, a diamond, an umbrella, a conch shell, and a palm leaf. The painting style resembles that of paint on paper, using the outline and wash technique with varied shades of cobalt blue adding dynamism and dimensionality to the waves and the scaly bodies of the fish and dragon. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, later replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
