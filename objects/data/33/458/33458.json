    "Description": "The lower register has scenes of the Annunciation, Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, and Entry into Jerusalem. The upper register depicts the Last Supper, Gethsemane, Crucifixion, and Entombment. The scenes are divided by colonnettes. Silver hinges are set diagonally. The two leaves are drilled with four extra holes at the top and bottom inner edges.\r\n\r\nThe so-called group of diptychs with colonnettes are consistent in style. They feature a conventional repertoire of doll-like figures and exaggerated gestures and tend to be rough in workmanship.",
