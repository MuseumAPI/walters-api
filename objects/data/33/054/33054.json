    "Description": "At the center of the composition is a pine tree with a small thatched hut at its base. Two buckets are in front of the hut. Behind it, at the top of the kozuka, is the water's edge. This may be a reference to seaside salt making in Japan. Salt water was boiled down to concentrate it and then spread out to evaporate. This process left behind salt crystals, which could be gathered and sold. The most famous literary salt makers in Japan are the two main characters in the noh play Matsukaze.",
