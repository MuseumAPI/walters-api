    "Description": "The book \"Journey to the West,\" published in the late 16th century, is a combination of fact, fancy, and allegory that tells of the adventures of a Chinese Buddhist monk who goes on a search for Buddhist scriptures.  The monk first encounters the main figure in this statue, Sha W\u00f9j\u00ecng, as a demon guarding a river.  Sha W\u00f9j\u00ecng  eventually becomes the third of the monk's three helpers.  The first (a small figure on the right) is a monkey; the second (on the left) has the face of a pig.\r\n\r\nThe tile is glazed in dark, crackled and mottled greens and browns.",
