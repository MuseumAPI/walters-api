    "Description": "\"At certain specified times during the year, the American Fur COmpany appoint a 'Rendezvous' at particular localites (selecting the most available spots) for the purpose of trading with Indians and Trappers, and here they congregate from all quarters.  The first day is devoted to 'High Jinks,' a species Saturnalia, in which feasting, drinking, and gambling form prominent parts.\"  A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
