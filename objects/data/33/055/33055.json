    "Description": "A female nude is seated on a drapery-covered conch shell borne on a wave. Her head is wreathed with rushes.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the 1877 Salon, Charles Timball made the following observations regarding the marble version of this statue:\r\n\r\nOne can be reproachful without being severe with the beautiful Triton, regarding some irregularities in her features. The face, one can more readily encounter on our highways and byways than in the bottoms of grottoes of the Aegean. But how can we not pardon the whimsical countenance of a goddess who shows us a back so well modelled, arms of such beautiful form terminated by hands which are vital to the tips of her fingernails.\r\n\r\nWhen acquired, the statuette had a silver rim about its lapis-lazuli socle. The root cavity of the tusk penetrates the bottom of the ivory.\r\n\r\nIt is signed on the wave: A. MOREAU-VAUTHIER.",
