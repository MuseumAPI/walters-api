    "Description": "The Evangelist Matthew is seated on a cushioned bench, his pen poised to write in a book supported by an elaborate animal-shaped lectern. He looks for inspiration to his symbol, the winged man. Matthew's drapery, which is drawn from the tradition of classical author portraits, cascades around him, lending the figure a sense of nervous energy as he prepares to write, an energy that is echoed in the tumultuous red and orange clouds behind him. This is a late example of the artistic style developed at the Carolingian school of Reims in the 830s and 840s.",
