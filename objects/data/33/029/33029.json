    "Description": "On a graceful meiping vase is painted a scene in underglaze cobalt blue. A traveler kneels before a martial resting his hand on the hilt of his sword. The heroic status of the martial is made apparent by the long pheasant plumes decorating his helmet and the two armed soldiers that accompany him. The traveler, dressed in official clothing, is depicted besides a river bank where his boat. Rocks and waving willows eclipsed by scrolling clouds are the setting for this dramatic scene which is likely derived from a novel. The neck is painted with splashes of bamboo, applied with thin brush strokes. \r\n\r\nDuring the Transitional period between the Ming and Qing dynasties, private kilns produced blue and white porcelain for private patrons. These patrons were often interested in naturalistic subjects such as figures, landscapes, and animals or scenes based on wood block illustrations from popular novels. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
