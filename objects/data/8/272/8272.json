    "Description": "Having himself depicted as the lightly clothed, muscular figure of Jupiter, king of the Olympian gods, is surely meant to suggest that Henry felt supremely confident of his invincibility. It is a clever political ploy of one who felt enemies on every side. His concerns were justified, as he was assassinated in 1609. The fierce eagle was Jupiter's pet and a suitable attribute of kingly ambition.\r\n\r\nThere are two other portraits of the king as well as the companion statuette of his wife Marie de' Medici nearby. These statuettes do not show the same precision and finesse as the bust and may be products of Jacquet's workshop, made to be given as gifts to supporters.\r\n",
