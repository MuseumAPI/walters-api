    "Description": "Such caskets for storing personal items and treasures were often decorated with romantic scenes from ancient mythology or an imagined past.  The subject of the lion hunt was found on Roman sarcophagi but made accessible for artists through Renaissance prints.  Reymond must have never seen lions, which here look like pesky dogs.  A mythical unicorn is featured on a side panel.\r\n\r\nThe clear, black contours reflect Reymond's reliance on prints for his designs, but the lively rendering of surfaces is his own.  Another version of this casket (present location unknown) is signed and dated 1547.",
