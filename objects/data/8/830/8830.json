    "Description": "Some people try to escape the stormy weather, while others chase hats that have blown off. Rather than being rooted in the Italian tradition of pastoral visions of an idealized past, this painting by an unknown artist draws on the more naturalistic tradition of Netherlandish landscape painting of the 17th century. It has been attributed in the past to the Venetian painter Antonio Diziani (1737-1797).\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 446, pp. 555-556.",
