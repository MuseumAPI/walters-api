    "Description": "This figure is the Chinese immortal Gama, with a three-legged frog on his back. Gama's spirit was able to leave his body to wander and once returned to find the body unfit. He put his spirit into the nearest creature, which was a frog. He is often paired with the immortal Tekkai, shown on Walters 51.1122, because they both had the ability to send their spirits out of their bodies.",
