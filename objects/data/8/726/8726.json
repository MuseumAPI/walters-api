He recorded his impressions in a notebook which he subsequently drew upon in preparing a number of oil paintings and large gouaches.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ruins visible on the cliffs date from the 13th century A.D., there is evidence of a sixth century substructure which lends credence to the legend that King Arthur was born on this site.",
