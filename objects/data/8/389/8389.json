    "Description": "The sober attire worn in the Netherlands in the mid 16th century did not preclude elegance or richness.  This woman's affluence is seen in her embroidered cap, pearl necklace, and the gold chain from which hangs a pierced metal container, or pomander.  Pomanders held sweet-smelling herbs to combat the foul smells generated by limited personal hygiene and public sanitation.  She faces to our left, very likely toward a companion portrait of her husband.\r\n\r\nKey worked in both the northern and southern provinces of the Netherlands (not yet politically divided into different countries).  The sculpted character of the face reflects traditions in the north, while the sophisticated handling of detail responds to those of the south.\r\n",
