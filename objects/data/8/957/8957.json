    "Description": "This page from Walters manuscript W.106 depicts a scene from Exodus, in which God rained plagues upon Egypt. The Lord told Moses (shown horned here as a sign of his encounter with divinity) to stretch forth his hand that a darkness might be placed over Egypt, a darkness that could be felt. Moses did so, and a darkness fell over the land for three days, but all the people of Israel had light where they dwelt. Yet still the Pharaoh would not let the Israelites leave Egypt.",
