    "Description": "A salt cellar such as this was typically part of a larger set of decorated table ware, including plates and bowls as well as matching basins and candlesticks. The river god alludes to the element of water and perhaps, therefore, to the sea as the source of salt. In the depression for the salt is an image of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom. On one of the short sides is a coat of arms with three turtles and the Greek word meaning slowness. The coat of arms and therefore the owner remains unidentified; however there were many contemporary sayings similar to \"haste makes waste,\" thus linking wisdom with carefulness.",
