    "Description": "This popular compositional type of carved ivory statuette depicting the Good Shepherd was apparently invented in Goa (west coast of India), a Portuguese colony and Jesuit training center for missionaries. At the bottom, Christ's follower Mary Magdalene reads scriptures in a mountain cave, where, according to legend, she retired in later life. Above is a fountain of life (suggestive of baptism) with doves and lambs, and at the top is the meditative figure of the Christ Child sitting with a lamb.\r\nChrist's eyes are closed. The gesture of his right hand,lightly touching his hair with two fingers, is seen by some scholars as adopting a gesture of the Buddha.\r\n",
