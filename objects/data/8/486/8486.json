    "Description": "Gruppe was born in Canada. Primarily a landscape and marine painter, he was largely self-taught although he spent time studying in Holland. He won many honors including a gold medal at the American Art Association in 1902, and silver medals for oils and watercolors at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. The Queen of Holland was one of his patrons. He was a member of the Pulchre Studio, The Hague; Arti, Amerdam; the New York Watercolor Club and the American Watercolor Society. This watercolor recalls the work of The Hague School which florished between 1860 and 1890 and included artists such as Jozef Isra\u00ebls and Jacob Maris.\r\n",
