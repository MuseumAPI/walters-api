    "Description": "Four winged dragons fill the compartments of this initial \"L,\" the sides of which are adorned with succulent green and blue profile foliage. Two confronted dragons in the lower part of the letterform bite a diminutive human head, as if battling over its possession. The \"L\" is topped by a human face, painted blue, from which emerge two intertwined, green bird-like dragons.",
