    "Description": "This intricate locket, with scenes inside and out, was probably used as a \"paternoster\", an aid to prayer similar to a rosary.  The scenes on the inside are executed in colorful enamel.  On the left, Christ is greeted as he enters Jerusalem on a donkey.  On the right, the risen Christ invites the \"doubting\" apostle Thomas to affirm his resurrection by touching his wound.\r\n\r\nOn the exterior (not visible) are two scenes executed in brown wax protected under rock crystal: the Virgin lamenting Christ's death, and a battered Christ shown to the people.\r\n",
