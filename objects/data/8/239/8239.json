    "Description": "This plate is decorate with plum blossoms reserved in white against a deep cobalt blue ground which resembles the cracking of an icy river at the end of winter. The sprigs of plum blossoms on the \"cracked ice\" ground symbolize the passing of winter and the approach of spring. This motif began during the reign of Kangxi (1662-1722) and would continue to be produced on nearly all forms of porcelain throughout the Qing dynasty. Eighteenth century examples of plum blossom and ice decoration appear especially on plates. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
