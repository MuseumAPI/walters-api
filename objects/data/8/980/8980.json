Fourteenth-century additions for the use of a woman suggest that it continued to be used by female supplicants for some time after its creation. A prefatory cycle of ten full-page miniatures was also added in the fourteenth century, which complemented the original, and more traditional, series of ten historiated initials found within the Psalter.",
