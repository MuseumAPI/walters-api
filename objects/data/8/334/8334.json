    "Description": "A painter of cityscapes, landscapes, Orientalist views, and still lifes in both oil and watercolor, he was exceptionally popular among the aristocracy and middle classes who collected art in the mid-19th century. He holds the honor of being the first living artist whose work was accepted into the Louvre, in 1910. Since then, his contributions to the development of modern art have been eclipsed by members of the canonical avant-garde, and his name has fallen into obscurity. \r\n\r\nIn this view of Venice, the reflections off the water, the filmy atmosphere, the network of masts, and the light gently playing across the surface of the distant architecture demonstrate the artist's concern for the poetics of space.",
