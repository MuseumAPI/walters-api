    "Description": "This Mughal painting, Walters W.698 attributable to the 12th century AH/AD 18th, depicts a court scene with a learned man addressing a seated Mughal ruler, most probably Jahangir (died 1037 AH/AD 1627). The painted images of Jesus and Mary behind him are found in other illustrations and are attested to in extant murals from Mughal India. On the back are Persian verses written in Nasta'liq script. The text is surrounded by an illuminated floral border comparable to those produced during the reign of Shah Jahan (reigned 1037 AH/AD 1628-1068 AH/AD 1657).",
