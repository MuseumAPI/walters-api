    "Description": "The Crucifixion is one of the most common themes carved on Byzantine ivory triptychs. While Saint John the Evangelist usually carries a Gospel Book, this ivory depicts him with both hands raised in adoration.  The Virgin's hands are covered with a fold of her mantle, a gesture of indicating grief.  All of the faces have been worn down over time, a clear indication that the ivory was stroked and rubbed during devotional prayers.",
