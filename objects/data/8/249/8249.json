    "Description": "While the mystics of the late Middle Ages pictured the tender incidents surrounding the birth of Christ, they also vividly portrayed the agonies of His death. On this devotional image Christ is pictured wearing the crown of thorns, placed on Christ's head to mock him as \"king.\" This kind of representation is called \"Ecce Homo,\" meaning \"Behold the Man,\" the words spoken by Pilate as he presented Jesus to the waiting crowd. Inscribed around the inner border are Christ's words to Pilate (John 18:37), \"I am a King; for this I was born and for this came I into the world that I should give testimony to the truth.\"",
