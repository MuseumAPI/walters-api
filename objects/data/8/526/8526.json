    "Description": "This fragment may have belonged to the same colorfully decorated tunic as Walters 83.727.  Both pieces tell the story of King David.  This fragment depicts David the musician.  The ankh, an ancient Egyptian symbol of life, was adopted by Egyptian Christians as a variant of the cross.  Its presence between the heads of the two figures suggests a Christian owner.  Several smaller roundels with equestrian figures originally accompanied the scene.",
