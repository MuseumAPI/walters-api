    "Description": "The Virgin supports the standing Child, who playfully pulls on her veil. Their poses represent the Child taking his first step, a warm, natural subject popular in Swiss and German regions, but less often portrayed in France. The statuette has a flat back for attachment to a larger object, such as a shrine or diptych (two hinged panels). Traces of polychromy still visible by the traces of red in the Virgin's hair and in the hem of Christ's robe.",
