    "Description": "The black protector Mahakala holds a skull cup in his left hand and a curved knife in his right. The enemies whose organs he severs with his knife can be regarded as both living in the world and existing only in our heads (as does, for instance, the notion of unique individuality).\r\n\r\nThe small figure at the center of the top is the Buddha Vajradhara, who revealed the teaching to the mahasiddha on his right. It was then passed down through time by the lamas who appear on the top row.\r\n\r\nMahakala was a Buddhist transformation of the Hindu Bhairava (a form of the god Shiva), appearing in a cremation ground. One of Bhairava's names was Mahakala (Great Black One, or Great Time, as in \"your time has come\").",
