    "Description": "A Sasanian king sits with his knees spread between two columns beneath a reversed arch.  He holds a sword with both hands and stylized plant forms emerge at his feet.  Some scholars suggest that the iconography of this image may have been transmitted through the influence of Persian textiles that entered Egpyt through trade and conquerors.  The carving was most likely rendered by an Egyptian carver during the Sasanian occupation of Egypt, from 619-639 CE.",
