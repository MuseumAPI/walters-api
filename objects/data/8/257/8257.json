He was canonized, or sainted, by Pope Leo X in 1514. Although the artist did not know what St. Bruno actually looked like, he created an individualized portrait with hollow cheeks and large eyes. These features, along with the landscape, make the saint seem quite real to the viewer.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 265, pp. 390-391.",
