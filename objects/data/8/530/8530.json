    "Description": "This painting is the second in a series of four depicting episodes from the life of the biblical figure Susanna. According to the Book of Daniel, two respected community elders confronted the beautiful Susanna while she was bathing in her private garden. They told her that they would accuse her of adultery unless she agreed to have sexual relations with them. When Susanna refused, the two men kept their promise and brought her to trial. In this painting, the two elders have just delivered their verdict, condemning Susanna to death. In the following panels she is vindicated and the elders are put to death instead.\r\n\r\nThis work-along with its three companion paintings-is known as a \"spalliera\" painting, from the Italian word for \"shoulder.\" It would have been displayed at shoulder height as part of the paneling of a wall in the room of a house.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see F. Zeri, Italian Paintings in the Walters Art Gallery, 1976, no. 66, pp. 103-105.",
