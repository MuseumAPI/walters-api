    "Description": "Samson, in classical armor, brandishes the ass's jawbone as he grasps the head of his victim. On the ground lies the corpse of another Philistine. At the right a party of horsemen, armed with lances and axes, tries to defend their comrade. A tree-topped hillock is at the left.\r\n\r\nThe composition is copied after the enameled plaque of the same subject in the museum of Dijon (no. 1555, dimensions 0.08 x 0.10 cm), which is impressed with the stamp used in the workshop of the P\u00e9nicaud at the time of Jean II. Our plaque is inferior in draughtsmanship and modeling to the Dijon example. It is difficult to decide whether with Walters plaque should be attributed to Jean P\u00e9nicaud III or given to an anonymous master of the second third of the 16th century who had been formed in the workshop of the P\u00e9nicaud.",
