Here, the scribe has accidentally left out a line of text, a common occurrence, usually corrected by simply adding the missing line elsewhere on the page. However this artist, perhaps the scribe himself, has used this error as an opportunity to have fun, and has drawn a figure hoisting the text into its proper place on the page.",
