    "Description": "During the period of peace after the Napoleonic Wars, the sumptuous arts experienced rapid recovery and gold once again became more reasonable. In England and France there emerged in the 1820s and early 1830s a taste for filigree jewelry known as cannetille work. Why these countries, with no previous history of filigree jewelry, should suddenly adopt this taste remains somewhat a mystery. It has been suggested that veterans of the Peninsular Wars returned from Portugal with examples of filigree jewelry for which that country was famous or that examples of filigree were arriving in western Europe as India was opened to commerce.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent, rather sumptuous example of cannetille work, which is more generally found in brooches or parures. The gold is of an attractive warm color suggesting some iron was used in the alloy.",
