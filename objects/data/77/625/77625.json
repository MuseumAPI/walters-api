The Naskh panels are flanked by illuminated medallions with a gold-tooled outline. The gold Thuluth lines are set apart by outlines resembling clouds. Illuminated rosettes serve as verse markers. The stamp in the left margin is the personal seal of the Vizier 'Ali Pasha, who gave the manuscript to an educational charity in 1130 AH/AD 1717.",
