    "Description": "Two separate episodes are depicted within a single frame. On the left, Christ's disciple Timothy is being clubbed to death by one of the pagans whose festival he had disrupted. He wears an episcopal stole (omophorion) because he is bishop of Ephesos. At the right, two men carry a coffin, while a priest before them swings a lit censer. This represents either the burial of Timothy at Ephesos or the translation (transfer) of his remains to the Constantinopolitan Church of the Holy Apostles in 356.",
