Cosimo wears modern armor and a large ruff, but he has chosen to have himself portrayed in profile, in imitation the profile portraits of emperors on ancient Roman coins.\r\n\r\nDupr\u00e9 was an important sculptor and medalist of the French court who made this medal during his travels in Italy in 1612-1614.",
