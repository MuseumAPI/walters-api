    "Description": "The 7th-century shogun Kamitsukeno Katana, trapped in his camp by an enemy siege and abandoned by his army, listens to his wife's advice as she serves him his evening meal. She objects to his plan for escape under cover of darkness, calling it cowardly and an offence to the gods. Instead, she convinces him to teach her and her women how to use a bow. The next day, seeing Katana at the head of a large group of warriors, the enemy raised their siege and fled.",
