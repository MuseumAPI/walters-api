    "Description": "By the middle of the 14th century, the ivory workshops of Paris were creating large-scale diptychs (two hinged panels) with numerous scenes from the Passion cycle. Thirteen are found here reading from top to bottom and left to right, Christ's Entry into Jerusalem, the Washing of the Feet, the Last Supper, the Garden of Gethsemane, the Arrest of Christ, the Hanging of Judas, the Flagellation of Christ, Christ bearing the Cross to Calvary, the Crucifixion, the Deposition, Entombment, Christ appearing to Mary (Noli me tangere) and Christ's Descent into Limbo. Notably Parisian in style are the slender figures with their swayed, elegant poses and smooth drapery folds. Diptychs were used as aids in prayer by the wealthy owners who commissioned them.",
