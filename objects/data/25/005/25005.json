    "Description": "Baltimore artist, Alfred Jacob Miller was a prolific sketcher.  He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).\r\n\r\n\"Oh clo' - Oh clo' \" \"Look here my friend - Whats the reason that you cannont say 'Old Clothes'?\" \"Sir - I can say Old CLothes as well as you can - but if you had to repeat it as often as I YOu would Say Oh Clo' too.\" -Miller",
