    "Description": "On the left, warriors in two boats reach out to retrieve an arrow that has fallen in the waters. On the right, mounted warriors wade into the water on horseback and also try to catch the bow. This scene is from the Battle of Yashima, which was fought in 1185 between the Minamoto and the Taira clans as part of a larger war to control Japan. The Minamoto leader at Yashima was Minamoto no Yoshitsune. When he dropped his bow in the water, he risked his life to reclaim it. Because the bow was small, he did not want the Taira to capture it and think that Minamoto warriors were weak.",
