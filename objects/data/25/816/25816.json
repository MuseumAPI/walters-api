    "Description": "This lapis lazuli scarab has a flat underside with a vertically arranged design of spiral scrolls. The scrolls are arranged below each other and both face with their open parts to the left. The design of the back of the scarab is detailed with fine incised lines, regular line flow, and almost balanced proportions. The workmanship of the scarab is slightly rough and the piece is simply made.\r\n\r\nThe scarab functioned as an amulet with a regenerative connotation and was originally mounted or threaded.\r\n\r\nThe bottom design was executed after the repair of the scarab. The height of the scarab makes it likely that it was originally created as inlay for a finger ring. Later the scarab was reused, and the second latitudinal hole was drilled.",
