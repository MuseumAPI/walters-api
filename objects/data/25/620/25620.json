    "Description": "While traditionally attributed to the famed rococo painter Fragonard, this miniature may be by his wife, Marie-Anne Fragonard, n\u00e9e G\u00e9rard. She never signed her work, and scholars now suspect that many miniatures, such as this one, once ascribed to her more famous husband are actually her work. The relative clumsiness of this miniature compared to the painterly verve and charm associated with Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's graceful art makes the attribution to J.-H. Fragonard unlikely.",
