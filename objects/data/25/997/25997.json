    "Description": "Towards the end of the reign of Maximilian I as Holy Roman Emperor (1493-1519), a new style of armor emerged in Germany.  Sometimes called \"Maximilian armor,\" it was in fashion from about 1510 until 1530.  Its distinctive fluting gave it strength without increasing its already substantial weight (a complete suit of armor weighed 40 to 50 pounds).  Though the elements of this suit are stylistically consistent, they were assembled from more than one source. An armored knight on horseback fought with a lance, but one on foot fought with a sword.",
