    "Description": "The use of forceful chiaroscuro (modeling in light and shade) is characteristic of Tiepolo's images of the Madonna and Child that were intended for private devotion. There is an element of melancholy in the way in which the Virgin embraces her son. This suggests that they both perceive his future fate, and the motif alludes to the traditional image of the Piet\u00e0, in which the Virgin mourns over the body of her dead son. She is often shown near or against a column, which here is meant to convey her nobility and strength.\r\n\r\nThese small images for private use are primarily from early in Tiepolo's career, before he was in great demand for large-scale commissions.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 448, pp. 558-559.",
