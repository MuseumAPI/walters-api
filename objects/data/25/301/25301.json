    "Description": "The suicide of the Roman heroine Lucretia was related by the historian Livy (59 BC-AD 17).  Raped by an Etruscan prince, she extracted an oath of vengeance from her father and husband and then stabbed herself.  As a result, the Etruscan kings were expelled and the Roman Republic established (late 6th century BC).  At the time, her response to being raped- suicide- was considered appropriate, even noble.\r\n\r\nBy the 1500s, Lucretia was depicted as a beautiful woman whose rich garments are pulled open and who plunges a dagger into her breast.  This dagger is inscribed with the mark of a Nuremberg goldsmith, Heinrich Ulrich.  The painter is identified only by his initials CSB (?), but the colors, mannerist figure type, and erotic overtones suggest a German artist at the Habsburg court in Prague around 1600.\r\n",
