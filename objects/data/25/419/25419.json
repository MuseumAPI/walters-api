    "Description": "This bowl is painted with dragons and waves in the famille verte style; underglaze cobalt blue is embellished with dazzling overglaze enamels of red, green, yellow, and aubergine/eggplant. On the exterior of the bowl, five-clawed dragons rise from the wildly crashing blue and green waves grasping for red flaming pearls. The beasts and the pearls they pursue hover among scrolling clouds and wispy flames. Bowls of this wide shallow shape, notched on the thin lip six times, often include a footed dome cover decorated with a similar delicately painted motif of dragons. This bowl and its sibling [WALTERS 49.1104] were purchased by Henry Walters at a sale in 1907.",
