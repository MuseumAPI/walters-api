    "Description": "George from Lydda (a town in Palestine) served in the Roman army and became a saint through the martyrdom he suffered on account of his Christian faith.  The popular legend about his defeat of a dragon symbolizes the victory of piety over sin and of good over evil.  This small image of the saint was used for personal prayer.  Its back side is rough and uneven, since it was originally embedded in a protective wooden panel: steatite, soft and easy to carve, also breaks easily.",
