This portrait was engraved about 1677, with the addition of an elaborate frame, by Pietro Aquila. Born in Flanders, Voet was one of the many Flemish painters who made their fortune in Rome, in Voet's case, as a portraitist of the wealthy.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this portrait, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 329, pp. 455-456.",
