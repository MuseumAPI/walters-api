    "Description": "The unknown artist of this relief depicted Saint Jerome in the desert with his faithful lion, which behaves like a well-trained dog.  In the distance, the artist modeled rocky planes in low relief while the grotto is in higher relief, casting dark shadows.  In this way, the artist, like the painters of his time, has created convincing spatial illusions.\r\n\r\nThe holes at the top indicate that the plaque once hung on the wall, perhaps in a monk's cell, as Jerome, the hermit saint, was a role model for monastic life.\r\n",
