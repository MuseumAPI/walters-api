    "Description": "Cattle graze on a slope overlooking a tranquil Alpine lake dotted with several sailing boats. The tranquility of the scene, the transparent atmosphere and the soft light suggest that the time of day is either dawn or dusk. When acquired, this painting was listed as the work of Adriaen van de Velde (1636-1672). More likely it is by a northern European, perhaps a Dutch artist, traveling in the Alps in the early 19th century.",
