    "Description": "The body of Christ is mounted by three nails to a modern Cross. His head is turned to the right and tilted backward. Christ is shown at the moment of death; his mouth is gaping, and his eyes are directly upward, with the pupils retracted. The body is subtly rendered, with particular attention given to the neck tendons and the muscular and skeletal structure of the limbs. A loincloth, held in position by a cord, is knotted at his right hip. The knot and both arms are carved separately. On the back of the skull is a drilled hole that may have been used for fastening a halo. An early 18th-century date is assigned to this work on the basis of the careful, restrained rendering of the subject.",
