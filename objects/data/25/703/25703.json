    "Description": "This panel depicting a lion and leopard hunt likely decorated a larger curtain or wall hanging.\r\n\r\nCurtains and wall hangings were used in private homes, as well as in public and religious buildings, to prevent drafts, divide spaces, and provide privacy. The tapestry weave of this piece is ideal for such textiles, as it produces a design that can be viewed from either side.\r\n\r\nThough found and probably manufactured in Egypt, this tapestry fragment shows strong Sassanian influence in the stylized animals, as well as in the depiction of the landscape. Close parallels exist in contemporary sculpture.",
