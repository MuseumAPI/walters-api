    "Description": "This large carved cameo in onyx, a mineral in which bands of color alternate, is signed on the lower edge by its maker, Henri Louis Fran\u00e7ois (1841-1896). A note in pencil on the side of the piece reads \"Unfinished when died - from sculptor's widow.\"\r\n\r\nThe cameo depicts the story of Daphnis and Chloe, orphaned children who grow up together and innocently fall in love. The orginal story is known from the romance written by the ancient Greek writer Longus in the 2nd century AD. The couple were popular subjects in 19th century art.\r\n\r\nFran\u00e7ois was a pupil of Bonnat and Chapu. From 1867 he exhibited cameos in various stones and at least one statuette at the Salon in Paris. These included subjects such as \"Liberty,\" \"Saint George,\" and \"Prometheus,\" as well as several scenes featuring Venus. He was an officer of the Legion d'Honneur and some of his work can be found in the Luxembourg Museum, Paris.\r\n",
