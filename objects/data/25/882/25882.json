    "Description": "Ushabti (meaning \"answerers\"), which resemble miniature mummies, were made of different materials such as wood or Egyptian faience (ceramic-like material). These funerary statuettes represent the individual whom they accompanied into the tomb and the afterlife. If a god called on the deceased to perform labor in the afterlife, this servant substitute, magically invoked by a traditional spell, would answer and do the work on behalf of the tomb's owner.\r\n\r\nThis ushabti figure displays its owner with a long wig and a divine chin beard with a plaited pattern and curved lower end. He holds hoes for field work in his hands and has a back pillar. The inscription, which contains the \"Ushabti-formula\" from the sixth chapter of the \"Book of the Dead,\" is laid out in nine rows below his arms.",
