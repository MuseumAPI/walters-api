The manuscript contains verses 142-252 of chapter 2 (Surat al-baqarah) and is volume 2 (al-juz' al-thani) of a 30-volume set. The text is written in large vocalized Muhaqqaq script in black ink with the alifs of prolongation superscripted in red ink. Rosettes with colored dots indicate each verse, and 5th and 10nth verses as well as section divisions are marked by inscribed illuminated polychrome forms. The light brown goatskin binding is decorated with blind- and gold-tooled geometric designs and is contemporary with the manuscript.",
