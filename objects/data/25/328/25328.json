    "Description": "This short, fat, clenched left hand must have been attached to a small statue, perhaps of a local god. On the wrist is a wide inlaid bracelet decorated by squares alternating with stripes. The hand is bent up slightly. The fingers taper unnaturally towards the (missing) thumb. The fingernails are cut very short and straight. The fingertips curve up. \r\n\r\nThe hand map have been part of a statuette made of several materials which were popular in Urartu (modern Armenia).",
