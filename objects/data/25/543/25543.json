    "Description": "Palden Lhamo is a female protector deity (especially of the Dalai Lamas) who accompanies the protector-deity Mahakala. She is frequently depicted alone, riding a mule, as in this thanka, where due to the gold-on-black medium she is an elusive presence. Her Sanskrit name is Shridevi (\"auspicious goddess\"), suggesting a relationship to the Hindu goddess of destruction, Kali. In this painting, she is accompanied by many ferocious attendants, each identified in tiny gold letters. The mountains and trees are those near a lake in Tibet where Palden Lhamo manifests herself.",
