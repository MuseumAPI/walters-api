    "Description": "The Virgin, her hands joined before her breast in an attitude of mourning, is represented as a half-length figure, facing three-quarters to the left. She wears a cobalt-blue robe, white wimple and a full blue mantle covering her head. The edge of the mantle was originally inscribed in gilding with words of the Ave Maria prayer, now effaced. Her sky-blue nimbus has a jeweled edge. The background is green, inscribed in faded gilt letters SCA MA and surrounded by a scalloped line in gilding, also very faded. The purple border following the rounded top is studded with raised \"jewels\" over spangles of foil. The enamel is mounted in a gilt metal frame.\r\n\r\nThe style of the drawing recalls that of Walters 44.149, and suggests a rather late date in the production of the Nardon P\u00e9nicaud workshop.",
