    "Description": "This plaque, along with Walters 71.175 are the only surviving ivories from a folding tabernacle that contained a Crucifixion. They are of unusually tall form, and combine features of the Rose Group in the bands of roses that divide the scenes horizontally with trefoil arches flanked by rosettes. The placement of this wing in the shrine was second from the left.\r\n\r\nThis wing is carved from bottom to top with the Arrest of Christ, Carrying of the Cross, and Three Marys at the Tomb. The wing is hinged on both sides with diagonally set iron hinges. \r\n\r\nWhile a couple of iconographical rarieties exist in the scenes on Walters 71.175, the scenes on this wing are typical of Rose Group ivories. A Parisian work may have served as the model. \r\n\r\nThe carving here is very uneven in quality. The enframements are unusual, and the form of a tabernacle for a central Crucifixion group is unique. These features, combined with the use of iron hinges, suggest a non-French center. The frequent use in Spain of tabernacle enclosures for sculpture would seem to confirm a Spanish attribution.\r\n\r\nBoth plaques have suffered from exposure. They have been cut horizontally at the top, and the remaining hinges have rusted and broken the ivory. There are iron nails centrally placed in the trefoil arches of three scenes. Each plaque is inscribed on the back: \"8809/R-73101/las dos tiras.\"",
