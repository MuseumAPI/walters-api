    "Description": "The Lord's Prayer is illustrated here, phrase by phrase, following the first panel in which Christ is surrounded by his apostles who have asked him to teach them how to pray. The passage translating \"Your will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven\" is poignantly illustrated by the image of Christ carrying the cross (top right), thereby accepting divine will that will lead to his death. The scenes are derived from engravings accompanying a 1523 treatise on the Lord's Prayer.\r\n\r\nThis altarpiece format encouraged personal prayer, as did the use of French (not everyone read Latin), reflecting Reform tendencies of the time. By mid-century, the use of \"grisaille\" (gray monochrome), suggestive of sculptural relief, had gained popularity, although initially mainly for mythological subjects.\r\n\r\nThe triptych is set in a later giltwood frame.\r\n",
