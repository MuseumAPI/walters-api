    "Description": "This scene depicts the first miracle of Christ, related in the Gospel of John. At a wedding, after all the wine had been drunk, Jesus ordered six jars to be filled with water, which he then turned into wine. Here, Jesus points to the jars while his mother gazes reverently at him.\r\n\r\nGandolfi introduces a variety of figures, including both an oriental man wearing a turban and an African servant, and anecdotal details (the fighting animals), resulting in a liveliness of pictorial expression comparable to Tiepolo.\r\nThis work was the \"modello\" (preparatory version) for an enormous canvas painted for the eating hall in the convent of San Salvatore in Bologna and now in the National Museum there.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 442, p. 553.",
