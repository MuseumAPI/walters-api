    "Description": "This plaque is part of a series whose designs were based upon the woodcut illustrations of an edition of Virgil, \"Opera,\" edited by Sebastian Brant and printed by Johann Gr\u00fcninger in Strasbourg, September 9, 1502 (96th illustration, fol. 329 vo). The same cuts appeared in an edition issued at Lyons in 1517 by Sacon.\r\n\r\nThe plaque depicts Messapus, leading a force of Etrurians and the Rutulians, who is terror-stricken at the sight of the Trojan vessels, which, having been set on fire by order of Turnus, were then metamorphosed by Jupiter at the prayer of the Mother of the Gods, Cybele. Near the burning ships appear two mermaids representing vessels already transformed. In the right upper corner Iris, sent by Juno, announces to Turnus that Aeneas has left his camp. In the middle ground the camp, designated by the banner inscribed TA (Troja), is represented as a medieval town.",
