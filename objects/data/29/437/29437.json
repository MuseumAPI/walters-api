    "Description": "The mark used on Chelsea porcelain from 1758 to 1769 was a gold anchor.  Objects from this period are commonly called gold-anchor wares.  This high jar not only has a gold anchor on its base, but also a rare gold letter, \"I.\"  It may be the initial of the painter or gilder who decorated the jar, or it could be a Roman numeral indicating the jar was one of a pair. The birds and trees were painted by Jeffreyes Hammet O'Neale.",
