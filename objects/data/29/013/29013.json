    "Description": "This image was commissioned by a senior monk (\"lochen\"), and it was made by Tsapa Namgyal, whom the inscription may characterize as an assistant sculptor. The artist is otherwise unknown, nor do we know who the donor was. \r\n\r\nSeveral Nagarjunas are familiar in the Indo-Tibetan tradition, the earliest and the most important being the one who flourished in India in the second century. He is regarded as the chief proponent of the Madhyamika school of Buddhist philosophy and the virtual founder of Mahayana Buddhism. However, at least two other major figures of Vajrayana Buddhism, who lived successively in the 10th and 11th centuries, are also known as Nagarjuna. The 11th-century Nagarjuna was an important mahasiddha (see Dowman 1985, pp. 112-22). Both the philosopher and the tantric teacher are given the same iconographic features.",
