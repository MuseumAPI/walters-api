    "Description": "A gemellion (from the Latin geminus, meaning \"twin\") is one of a pair of basins used for hand washing, either at home or during the Mass. Water was poured from the spouted bowl and was caught in the second bowl placed below. Many gemellions made in the enamel manufacturing center of Limoges, France, were decorated with secular-themed designs of birds, beasts, or courtly scenes. This bowl shows a rider on horseback hunting with his bird of prey and two dogs in the central medallion and busts of angels on the surround.",
