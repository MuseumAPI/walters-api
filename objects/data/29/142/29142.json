    "Description": "This is a Sihing-type image with certain traits that link it to the Nakhon Si Thammarat tradition: a robe edge running from mantle to wrist, and folded pleats spread out in front of the ankles. On a separately cast base are two warriors from Mara's army, at left and right, with a third warrior in a splayed-leg heraldic pose at the center. Between his legs is a face, to which he has seemingly just given birth. The original names for these figures are not known, but there are other ensembles with similar representations.",
