    "Description": "This small bronze was once part of an assembly of deities composed of about 100 figures of varying size and importance, with the central one standing for supreme truth. Such an assembly, or mandala, was the visual counterpart of an elaborate mental exercise, a sequence of meditations, or trances, leading to an enlightened state of mind.\r\n\r\nThe figure belonged to a group of female musicians. Turning to her left, she holds a long drum against her knee with her left hand and beats it with her right. Seated in a swaying dhyansana pose and wearing an ornate jatamukuta and arm and leg ornaments.  On a stepped lotus plinth.",
