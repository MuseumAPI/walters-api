On the reverse are two scenes. On the left, two nude boys, one with a bow and the other with a hand cannon, shoot at a sitting duck. On the right, a youth pulls off the stocking of a seated woman. The scenes are set against a coarsely crosshatched ground.\r\n\r\nThe small and large teeth have all been replaced by sections inset into the frame.",
