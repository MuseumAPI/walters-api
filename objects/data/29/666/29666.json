    "Description": "Aghasura is one of the many antagonists who challenge Krishna during his childhood. This conflict occurs in Krishna's fifth year. Aghasura transforms himself into a gigantic reptile and lies with his cavernous mouth open, hoping to lure the cowherd boys. Unable to contain their curiosity, the boys stroll into the mouth and are swallowed. Krishna, however, is not fooled. He enters the mouth, chokes the creature, and rescues his companions.\r\n\r\nThe unknown artist of this series, while taking some liberties, on the whole has remained faithful to the narrative. The boys, including Krishna, are not five years old but adolescents and enter the mouth with their cattle. Aghasura looks more like a giant white whale than the reptile of the text. In fact, he is a giant makara. Krishna is portrayed a second time, dancing victoriously behind Aghasura's shoulder. Separated by a thin white line, the scene in the upper register, which represents paradise, follows the text explicitly. The celestials worship Krishna with flowers, the apsaras with dance, and the brahmins with chants. Brahma, too, joins the celebration and is included in the upper left corner in his hieratic form. The two figures seated in conversation within a red box between two other divinities shower flowers, which, however, have not been shown. The chanting brahmins are framed by two trees.",
