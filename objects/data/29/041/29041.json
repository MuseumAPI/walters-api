    "Description": "The dining room, or \"triclinium,\" of a Roman house derived its name from the three couches that were grouped at right angles to one another in a U-shape.  Wealthy citizens ate while reclining on these couches.  On this example, bronze fittings decorate a wood frame (restored).  Straps originally would have supported a mattress covered with luxurious textiles.  The ends of the couch are decorated with bronze fulcra, the curving ends of the armrests, which terminate in lion heads in the front and duck heads in the back.  Couches were highly valued pieces of furniture that were often buried with honored family members.",
