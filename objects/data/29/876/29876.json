    "Description": "A \"mihrab\" is a niche in a mosque or other Muslim religious building that indicates the direction for prayer toward Mecca. It also recalls the place where the prophet Muhammad stood to lead the early Muslim community in prayer, and symbolizes both the entrance of God's presence into the place of worship and the gateway to heaven. Ceramic plaques in the shape of \"mihrabs\" are often found in shrines and mausoleums and on tombstones and cenotaphs (funerary monuments), where they may have had a commemorative or memorial function.\r\n\r\nWith its combination of molded and painted decoration, this blue and brown lusterware work is typical of ceramic \"mihrab\" plaques made in medieval Iran. The large inscription in the outer frame begins with the \"bismallah\" (\"In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate\") and continues with a Qur'anic verse that refers directly to the recitation and prayer that Muslims perform in front of a \"mihrab\": \"Establish regular prayers at the sun's decline till the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony\" (Sura al-Bani Isra'il: chapter 17, verse 78). One of the final, and shortest, chapters of the Qur'an (Sura al-Ikhlas: chapter 112) is inscribed on the white band around the central arch.\r\n\r\n",
