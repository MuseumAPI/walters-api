    "Description": "The Bassin was constructed in the former village of La Villette between 1806 and 1809 to provide a harbor and a reservoir. It was formed from the Canal d'Ourcq connecting the Ourcq, a tributary of the Marne, with the Seine. \r\n\r\nL\u00e9pine produced a number of paintings of this waterway conveniently located east of Montmartre. Here he shows it on a sunny, though hazy and apparently humid day. Flanking the waterway are numerous barges and warehouses.\r\n\r\nA similar view, \"Le Bassin de La Villette,\" is illustrated in John Couper, \"Stanislas L\u00e9pine, sa vie, son oeuvre,\" Paris, 1969, fig. 31.",
