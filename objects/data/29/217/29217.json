    "Description": "Many religions were syncretistic, meaning that as they grew and came into contact with other religions, they adopted new beliefs and modified their practices to reflect their changing environment. Both Greek and Roman religious beliefs were deeply influenced by the so-called mystery religions of the East, including the Egyptian cult of Isis, which revealed beliefs and practices to the initiated that remained unexplained, or mysterious, to the uninitiated. Most popular Roman cults had associations with these mystery religions and included the prospect of an afterlife.\r\n\r\nThe statuette is recognized as Athena Promachos (\"the Warrior\") by her helmet and stance, her stiff left leg advanced. The details of her garments imitate the Korai (statues of maidens) of the late 6th century BC. Her raised right arm supported a spear.\r\n",
