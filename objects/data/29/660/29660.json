    "Description": "The Virgin supports the Child with her left hand, and the Child grasps the end of her head cloth and holds a goldfinch, referencing Christ's suffering on the cross. The Virgin's crown is carved of ivory.\r\n\r\nThe Virgin's right hand with the apple and the Child's upper torso, including his left hand and the bird, are restorations. There are repairs on the base, the Virgin's feet, and the lower edges of the Virgin's drapery. The very skillful restorations were probably executed by the same restorer who inset the torso of the Christ Child on Walters 71.240, which was in the Carlo Micheli Collection before 1895.",
