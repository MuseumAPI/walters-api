    "Description": "An elderly shepherd glances apprehensively over his shoulder as two ragged and hungry wolves slink at his heels, while a third howls in the bushes behind. The inscription on the tablet describes how the old man, unable to protect all of his sheep, threatens to abandon them all. The work represents the early style of the artist, in which the composition was painted in grisaille and then covered with colored translucent enamels.",
