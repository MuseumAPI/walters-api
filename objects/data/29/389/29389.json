    "Description": "A white cow drinking in the foreground is about to be joined by three other cows progressing at intervals toward the pool. They are tended by a girl leaning against a gatepost. The scene is drenched by early morning sunlight.\r\n\r\nEmile van Marcke de Lummen was born in S\u00e8vres, France, the location of one of the most prominent porcelain factories.  Van Marcke, and many members of his family, were employed there. Working here he was introduced to Troyon, one of the foremost porcelain painters, who served as a large influence on van Marcke's area of interest - cows and other animals.",
