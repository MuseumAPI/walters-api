There is a gadrooned hollow in reserve with vertical leaf-motifs alternatingly red and blue. The center in ochre is decorated with masks, palmettes and leaf-scrolls. A painted bead and reel border surrounds the central boss on which is the standing figure of a saint in a landscape with \"S\" crossed by a paraph and \"SI.\" The back has a radial ring of large petals that covers the marli and the hollow striped with blue, ochre and green; in the center the letters \"S\" and \"CE\" in blue outlines are crossed by paraphs; the surrounding spaces are filled by blue line scrolls.",
