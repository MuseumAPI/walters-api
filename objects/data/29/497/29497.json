    "Description": "The lion-griffin head is worked in repouss\u00e9 in two halves, left and right and chased; ears, teeth and crest were separately made and applied. Two holes remain where the griffin horns once were.\r\n\r\nProbably contemporary with the lion head hoop (Walters 57.1665), the lion-griffin head hoop introduces an Achaemenid motif into the Hellenistic repertory. This type is less widespread than the lion head hoop.",
