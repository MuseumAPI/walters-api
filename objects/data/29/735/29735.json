    "Description": "The nude, bald Infant is shown on his back with his right arm resting over his chest and his left at his side. The sculptor has striven for verisimilitude in the renderings of the folds of the flesh and in the use of inset glass eyes. The lips have been painted red, and traces of pink are still visible in the wrinkles on the back.\r\n\r\nSuch figures are presumed to have been used in cr\u00e8ches. The space between the arms and the torso suggests that a costume may have been added. The figure's right index finger and the large toe of his left foot have been repaired. A plug has been set in the Child's head and a hole drilled in the right foot.",
