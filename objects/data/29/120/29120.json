The thunderbolt seems to have one screw end. A chlamys is thrown over the left shoulder and upper arm, and falls to the back and front. The head is bearded and turns slightly to the right. A protuberance at the front of the head shows that there was some sort of diadem or garland; ribbons from the end of this ornament reach the shoulders.",
