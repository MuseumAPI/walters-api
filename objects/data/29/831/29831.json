    "Description": "This statuette is based on a famous Roman bronze statue of a boy sitting on a tree stump pulling a thorn (spina) from his foot.  The sculpture had been known since the 12th century, when it stood outside the Lateran Palace in Rome.  At the end of the 15th century, it was transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, where it can still be seen.  The antique statue was much admired because of its graceful naturalism in depicting an intimate, human moment.\r\n\r\nThe style of modeling and treatment of the surfaces are those of the influential bronze founder and sculptor Severo da Ravenna, who produced small-scale copies of famous antique sculptures.\r\n",
