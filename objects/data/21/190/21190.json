Although the sitter is identified only as Miss Moffat, this portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy (no. 72) in London in 1826. Four years later, Shee was elected president of the Academy. \r\n\r\nA young woman of high complexion and light brown hair, identified only as Miss Moffat, is removing a strand of pearls from a gold jewelry box.  She wears a henna-colored dress and is posed against a dramatic, partially overcast sky.",
