The scene must have been taken from a Dutch, or perhaps Flemish, drawing and is carved in ivory with the Judgment of Solomon. The ivory bottom of the box is carved with a Baroque scroll.\r\n\r\nA rather similar box, in mother-of-pearl and showing Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea, is in the Walters Collection (Walters 57.107). It is marked by an Amsterdam marker and dated 1739.",
