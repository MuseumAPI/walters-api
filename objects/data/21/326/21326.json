    "Description": "This tea jar is an example of blue and white porcelain exported to Japan in the 16th century. A scene with two figures, mountains, and architectural elements is painted in underglaze cobalt blue on the cylindrical body o the jar. The overglaze enamels in bright red, green, and yellow are a Japanese addition. Atop the jar is a flat and round lid embellished with a three dimensional sculpture of a lion painted in both underglaze blue and overglaze red. \r\n\r\nExploitation of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen caused an influx of porcelain artists to begin private practice at private kilns during the Transitional period (1620-1683) between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Manchu occupation of China also shut down most of the imperial kilns. Private kilns produced functional and economic shapes painted with naturalistic subjects (human figures, animals, landscapes) based on wood block illustrations from novels. Export porcelains continued to ship to European and Japanese markets. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. \r\n",
