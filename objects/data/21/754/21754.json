    "Description": "Adam and Eve, the first humans, are depicted at the moment of their transgression, which led to their expulsion from Eden. Spurred on by the serpent, Eve hands Adam an apple from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The monkey, an animal known for its lustfulness, indicates their folly.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of Adam and Eve are arranged in graceful curves that draw them together around the central axis of the tree. The representation of a leafy tree, a motif associated with landscape painting, is a striking example of a 17th-century sculptor challenging the limits of his medium in the pursuit of naturalism.\r\n",
