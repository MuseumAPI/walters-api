    "Description": "Used for personal devotion, this diptych could be closed and easily carried by its owner. Its four reliefs summarize salvation history from the Incarnation to the Second Coming. The owner could have identified with worshiping figures like Joseph bending over his newborn son, the Magus kneeling to present his gifts to him, the apostle John mourning at Calvary, or the dead rising from their graves on Judgment Day. The scenes from Jesus' earthly life include strikingly human, emotional details: the Virgin tenderly grasps the infant's hand, Christ playfully holds up the Magi's gifts, and Mary swoons at the sight of her son's death. As a reminder of the future judgment, the Virgin is shown on the lower right imploring Christ to forgive our sins.",
