    "Description": "An 18th-century Chinese porcelain vase, reputed to be the finest of its kind, was sold for $18,000 at the auction of the Mary J. Morgan estate in 1886 in New York. So controversial was the price that William T. Walters never admitted to being the purchaser (the vase is presently displayed in Hackerman House). Almost immediately, replicas of the vase appeared in glass and ceramic. Known as \"Peach Blow\" vases, the glass versions were made with layered glass-red to yellow on the exterior and milky white inside.\r\n",
