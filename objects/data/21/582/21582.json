    "Description": "Priests oversaw the rituals, mummifications, funerals, and burials of sacred temple animals. By the mid-1st millennium BC, people were encouraged to pay for the mummification as a sacred offering to the related deity. A cat mummy would be offered to a feline deity, such as Bastet. This was a lucrative business, and \"false\" mummies were sometimes created to meet the demand. Actually, this is one of those: X-rays show that there is nothing inside the wrappings.",
