    "Description": "This drawing, rendered more in tonal contrasts than in line, shows a dimly lit cottage interior. Three youths pray on a roughly hewn bench in front of a cupboard surmounted by a votive statue. Their clogs are scattered across the floor. An image of the Virgin is partially visible to their right, and beyond is a large fireplace with a rustic mantle. The stone blocks elevating the cupboard above the ground indicate that the cottage floor is made of dirt. A bent taper has not been lit, and the raking illumination appears to come from a door or window beyond the picture.\t",
