    "Description": "\"At four o'clock in the morning, it is the duty of the last men on guard to loosen the horses from their pickets, in order to range and feed.  At daylight, everybody is up;- our provisors are busy with preparations for breakfast;- tents and lodges are collapsed, suddenly thrown down, wrapped up, and bundled into the wagons.  If the sun is 20 minutes above the horizon when our breakfast is finished, we conceive he has a reproachful look.  By this time the horses are driven in, and each man hurries after his own, saddles or harnesses him, and the train puts itself en route.\" A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
