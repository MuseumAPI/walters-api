    "Description": "At the right of this tsuba, sits the sage Taik\u00f4b\u00f4 (Ch. Tai Gongwang) fishing. His tea pot and basket are sitting behind him on the reverse. Taik\u00f4b\u00f4 did not use bait, because he did not actually want to catch fish. He used fishing as an excuse to think about scientific questions. He met 12th-century BC emperor Wu Wang when the emperor was hunting and Taik\u00f4b\u00f4 was fishing. The emperor was so impressed with Taik\u00f4b\u00f4, that he asked him to serve as a counselor. Taik\u00f4b\u00f4 served the emperor for twenty years.",
