    "Description": "Mourning miniatures were very popular in the Romantic period and this design is typical for the late 18th and early 19th century. A classically dressed woman lays a wreath on an urn atop a tomb. The inscription on the tomb reads, \"In memory of Geo. Chambers.\" In the background is a willow tree, associated with both mourning and new life. Almost monochrome, there are touches of pink on the woman's face and hands. On the back of the miniature is a panel of woven hair, and the monogram in pressed gold \"EC,\" suggesting that this miniature by have been reworked to commemorate another family member as well as George. This miniature was gifted to the museum in a silk-lined red leather case.",
