    "Description": "An elderly teacher pursues a naked young boy who flees, carrying his clothes over his arm. Behind, in a shallow pond, several youths are cavorting, one of whom prances beside the water jeering at the departing figure. A warm evening light permeates the scene. \r\n\r\nThe model for the old teacher was used by Knaus in several works including \"The Village Sorceress\" (1885) and \"The Potato Gathering\" (1889).",
