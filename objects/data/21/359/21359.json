    "Description": "These ten beads were probably part of a woman's necklace. They are made of thin sheet gold that was cut and folded around a core of pitch (pine resin). Slices of garnet, backed with foil to enhance their brilliance, were inserted into the pitch between the gold frames. This technique of combining gold and foil-backed garnets is characteristic of the Goths of South Russia.",
