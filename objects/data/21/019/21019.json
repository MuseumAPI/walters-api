    "Description": "At the same time that Thai sculptors were casting what are now considered the classic bronze images of the Buddha, potters in the Sukhothai region were producing vast quantities of ceramics. Thousands and thousands of dishes and covered bowls were shipped to the islands of Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThis architectural fixture was made for local use. The four-faced god is probably a Buddhist manifestation of the Hindu creator-god Brahma. He and other Brahmas reside in the upper tiers of heaven, which are reserved for gods in deep, long-lasting trances. This sculpture might once have been placed atop a gate.\r\n",
