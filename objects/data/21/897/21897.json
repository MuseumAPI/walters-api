    "Description": "This locket features two Buddhist deities with different functions. On the left is the \"1,000-armed Kannon\" (Avalokiteshvara), symbolizing compassion for all living creatures. On the right is a \"King of Desire\" named Aizen Myoo, with a ferocious facial expression. The lion head over his forehead stands for his capacity to transform lust into pure love. This locket, made to be carried by a Buddhist priest, is likely to have survived because it was part of a sacred deposit inside a large wooden image in a temple.",
