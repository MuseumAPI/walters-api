    "Description": "Lucas Cranach the Elder, the greatest German artist of the 16th century after Albrecht D\u00fcrer, painted several small images of beguiling young women-often superficially justified by a moral association for the private enjoyment of his aristocratic male patrons. \r\n\r\nIndeed, this attractive young woman in rich attire sends mixed signals. Her hair hangs loosely, so she is a not married woman, whose hair would be discretely controlled. In a formal portrait, this would indicate that she is a virgin. However, she engages the viewer directly with an unabashed gaze and an expression suggesting familiarity. This would be inappropriate for an unmarried woman of a respectable family. Her gold jewelry and velvet dress is fashionable, but she wears no high-necked blouse under it. This provocative young woman could be Mary Magdalene, often said to have been a prostitute before she met Christ. \r\n",
