    "Description": "Glazed earthenware was popular for containers for the remedies dispensed by Renaissance pharmacists. These jars were arranged in easily accessible shelves around the walls of the apothecary's shop, with painted or attached labels to identify their contents. This jar is part of a large and distinctive group of wares often called the Orsini-Colonna series, because a plate from the series (now in the British Museum) celebrates the reconciliation of these two rival families. \r\n\r\nThe inscription reveals that the jar was for syrup made from the flowers of French lavender (Lavandula stoechas), used to soothe headaches and relax nerves. Witty and fantastic ornaments were common to apothecary wares, as on this jar where the healing syrup would have flowed from the mouth of a dragon.\r\n",
