This casket is in the form of a \"teremok,\" the upper portion of a house that was set aside for women in Russian noble households during the 16th and 17th centuries.\r\n\r\nProbably intended for jewelry, the casket has a large compartment below, and the lid itself contains a compartment; both were probably once fitted with special containers.",
