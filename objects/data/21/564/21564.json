    "Description": "The calendar itself starts on fol. 1r, half way through the month of January, and ends on fol. 12r, with December. Fol. 12v contains a table of the dates of Easter. Fol. 13r contains a list of days of fairs at certain towns. Fols. 13v-14v are blank. The quire structure is regular, fols. 6/7, 5/8, 4/9, 3/10, 2/11, and 1/12 are conjoint. Fols. 13 and 14 are singletons. Fol. 13 was presumably once conjoint with the now missing first part of the text, and it is likely that fol. 14 was once conjoint with a (possibly blank) page prefatory to the calendar. Judging by the degree of wear on the present fol. 1r, the first page of the calendar has been lost for many years. Structurally, however, the present fragment probably formed a discrete \"booklet\" within the Hours of which it was once a part.",
