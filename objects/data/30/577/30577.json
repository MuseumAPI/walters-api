    "Description": "After Thomas Becket was murdered in 1170, a cult emerged and he became the symbol of the conflict between temporal and spiritual rulers at a time when European monarchs were struggling to affirm their sovereignty over the Church. Accounts of miracles at the sanctuary of Christ Church Cathedral in Canterbury began to circulate, and Becket's tomb quickly became a popular pilgrimage destination. His growing renown led to his canonization little more than two years after his death, officially endorsing popular practice and belief. Pilgrims could buy mementos at the shrine such as badges like this one, which spread the saint's fame through much of northern Europe.",
