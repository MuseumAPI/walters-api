    "Description": "Carved in high relief on the front are four cupids carrying fruit and baskets. The figures may well represent the four seasons.\r\n\r\nThe upper left and right edges are broken off but with no loss of the relief, except the wings of the rightmost figure. The upper border is recessed as if to receive the flange of a lid and has a center hole, possibly part of the clasp. A horizontal slit on the lower back probably held the floor of the box; the rest of the back surface is smooth.",
