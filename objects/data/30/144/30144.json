    "Description": "Though he may appear as a mere child playfully sucking on his toes, Krishna is in fact an incarnation of the powerful god Vishnu. This devotional image portrays a vision the sage Markandeya once had, when he saw the infant lying on a banyan leaf floating in the cosmic ocean. When Krishna revealed his true form, it was the all-pervading Vishnu, resting on the primordial waters between cosmic eras, when he gives rise to the re-creation of the universe.",
