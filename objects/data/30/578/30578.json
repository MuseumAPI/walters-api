    "Description": "Pascal Paoli (1725-1807) was a Corsican general and patriot, and ruled Corsica from 1755 to 1769. After he resigned he lived in London until his death in 1807. \r\n\r\nHenry Pierce Bone's father was the noted enamel painter Henry Bone (1755-1834) and his mother was also descended from an artistic family. His brother William Bone Senior (active 1810-43), was also an enameller. Henry turned to enamels after first painting mostly in oils. In 1846 he published a catalogue of his enamels. He was appointed successively enamel painter to Queen Adelaide, and to Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. Several works by the artist can be found in the Royal Collection. He typically copied other paintings for his enamels, as with his series of British monarchs. The original painting by Beechey shows the general at three quarter length seated in a red velvet chair, with a view of mountains through a window beyond.",
