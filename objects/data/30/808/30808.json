    "Description": "This red-figure bell-krater depicts satyrs and maenads revelling on the front. On the left a satyr wearing a fawn skin for a cloak and a wreath stands to the right; in his right hand he holds up a thyrsos from which an ivy vine hangs. In front of him a maenad dances right, looking around. She wears a peplos girded at the waist, bracelets, earring, wreath and possibly a necklace. Over her head she holds a thyrsos in her right hand, and in her left is a tympanum. Next comes a satyr who goes right, looking around. He also wears a fawn skin for a cloak and a wreath. His right arm is extended back over his head, and in his left hand he holds a thyrsos. On the right another maenad dances right, looking around. She wears a peplos, diadem, earring, necklace, bracelets, and wreath, and holds a ribbon between her hands. Rocks and foliage fill out the scene.\r\n\r\nOn the back are three mantled youths, two to the right and the third to the left. The first holds a circular object (possibly a aryballos) in his extended right hand. The one in the center gestures withhis right hand. The third holds an aryballos by a string in his extended right hand. A strigil hangs by his head. The last two wear fillets.\r\n\r\nRevelling satyrs and maenads is a popular subject at this time, and similarly posed dancing figures are common.",
