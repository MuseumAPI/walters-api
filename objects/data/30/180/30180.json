    "Description": "This large pendant has a detailed mythological scene engraved in the agate. Ariadne is abandoned on the island of Naxos by the Athenian hero Theseus, indicated by the ships on the right leaving the island without Ariadne. Theseus had fled with her from Crete, where she had helped him escape the famous labyrinth commissioned by her father Minos after Theseus killed the ghastly Minotaur and freed the Athenian youths held hostage there. The reason for Theseus's unheroic behavior can be seen on the left side of the pendant: the god Dionysus is approaching in a chariot drawn by goat-legged followers. He has fallen in love with Ariadne and so marries her.",
