    "Description": "Christ and the apostles are gathered around a table framed by buildings and porticoes evocative of Jerusalem. Two of the apostles (right) try to prevent Judas from dipping his hand into the central bowl containing a fish, symbol of Christ himself. This ivory plaque, with an abstract, geometric style based on Byzantine models, is one of three from a larger ensemble of the Passion cycle, perhaps from an altar frontal. Two related plaques featuring the Washing of the Feet and the Prayer at the Mount of Olives are in the Museo Civico, Bologna.",
