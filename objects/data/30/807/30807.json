    "Description": "This triptych (three-paneled icon) is distinguished by its somber colors, linear patterns, and sense of quiet melancholy. The combination of white and black bands on the wings, which is rare in Ethiopian art, creates a bold pattern that serves as a background for Christ and the saints. The victorious, resurrected Christ, seen at the upper right, holds in his hand a processional cross.",
