    "Description": "The wings of the goddess Nike, who personified military victory as well as triumph in athletic or musical competitions, probably indicate her ability to bring swift victory. Like Eros, Nike was a familiar figure in Greek art. Scenes showing a flying Nike became very popular in the early 5th century BC, which was probably connected to the victory of the Greeks over the Persians at the battle of Marathon (490 BC).",
