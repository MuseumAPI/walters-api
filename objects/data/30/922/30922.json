This fragment is all that remains of a circular relief that was attached to a reliquary (probably destroyed) in a famous collection of liturgical vessels established by Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg (1490-1545) in Halle, Germany. The reliquary, with the relief, was documented in a drawing made about 1520 for a catalogue of the collection.",
