    "Description": "During his youth, this early Romantic artist joined Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and Richard Parkes Bonington (1802-28) in painting marine scenes on both sides of the English Channel. Later, Isabey turned to historical genre subjects of the type depicted in this painting.\r\n\r\nThe picture shows a scene from the life of Elisabeth of Valois (1545-68), the daughter of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. Elisabeth was briefly betrothed to Don Carlos, prince of Asturias, but for reasons of state was compelled to marry the prince's father, King Philip II of Spain. Isabey depicts the unhappy princess, dressed more like a widow than a bride, swooning as she is led to the carriage that will bear her away from France.",
