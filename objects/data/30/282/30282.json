    "Description": "L\u00e9pine, a self-taught artist, sought the advice of Camille Corot and Johann Barthold Jongkind, two artists who influenced the early development of Impressionism, and he participated in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874. Although he shared the Impressionists' interests in atmospheric effects, his views of Paris and the Seine River were characterized by their distinctively delicate treatment. His works are devoid of any romantic overtones, and human figures, when they occur, are subordinated to the settings.  In this small painting, Paris and the Seine are shown bathed in warm sunlight. Extending across the river in the middle ground is the small foot bridge, the \"pont de l'Estacade,\" which was erected in 1818, rebuilt on several occasions, and demolished in 1938. Slightly beyond is the Pont Sully, constructed in 1874-76, connecting the Ile Saint Louis with the Right Bank. The dome in the center of the picture is that of the church of St. Louis and St. Paul on the rue St. Antoine.The artist apparently painted the view from a quai near the Port-aux-Vins. This painting is thought to be one of several small canvases that was executed in preparation for a larger work, \"The Seine at the Estacade,\" that was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1885 (#1561).\r\n",
