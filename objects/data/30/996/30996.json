    "Description": "The unforgiving, linear rendering of the man's face suggests the influence of Quentin Metsys (1466-1530), the leading painter in Antwerp during the early decades of the century.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the sitter chose to be portrayed fingering his red-coral rosary beads suggests that piety was important to his sense of identity.  He may also have been superstitious: coral was not only beautiful and expensive, it was believed to protect against evil.\r\n",
