    "Description": "This manuscript, illustrated with 155 marginal paintings, is one the few surviving marginal psalters, in which images provide a pictorial commentary on the Biblical text. Other examples include the Khludov Psalter (ca. 850 CE, Moscow, State Historical Museum, Muz. 129), the Barberini Psalter (ca. 1050 CE, Vat. Barb. Gr. 372), the Theodore Psalter (1066 CE,  London, British Library, Add. Ms. 19,352), and a Cyrillic psalter made in Kiev (1397 CE, Saint Petersburg, National Library of Russia, cod. OLDP, F6). The Walters' psalter was apparently copied from the same eleventh-century model as the Saint Petersburg manuscript, as the iconography of the two is very similar.",
