This extravagant example, exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) of 1900 as part of a display intended to highlight the mineral wealth of the United States, was designed by Paulding Farnham. The gems for the blossom were selected by George Frederick Kunz, a renowned geologist and gemologist who worked for Tiffany.",
