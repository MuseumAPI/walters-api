    "Description": "This multi-figure subject of two Roman soldiers tormenting the seated Christ was much more of a challenge to carve from an ivory tusk than the more common choice of the single figure of  the tormented Christ, relying on the viewer's imagination to fill in the rest of the scene, as in Christ at the Column (71.356). That challenge may have been the point. The combination of elongated bodies, harsh, realistic details, such as the strained faces or flapping skirts of the soldier's armor,  and the raw, awkward energy of the piece suggest that it was carved in Germany around in the decades preceding the highpoint of this approach in the work of  the artist known as the Master of the Furies (71.435).",
