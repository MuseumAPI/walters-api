    "Description": "Round or rectangular panels of stained glass added decoration as well as changing colored light patterns to a room. They were set into larger windows made up of small segments of clear glass in either a diamond or round (bull's-eye or bottle) pattern, held together with strips of metal.\r\n\r\nWithin the quatrefoil (four-lobe design) are jousting knights, who bear the coats of arms of the Geuder and Rieter von Kronburg families, with their heralds gathered below. The centrally featured coats of arms are the Habsburg double-headed eagle with the combined arms of the houses of Austria and Burgundy on its breast, the Nuremberg \"virgin eagle\" (municipal emblem) with (to the right) the arms of Nuremberg as an imperial city, and, below, the stars of the Geuder family.\r\n",
