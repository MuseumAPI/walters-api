    "Description": "This carved walrus-ivory panel, in a decorative frame of repouss\u00e9 silver with a loop for suspension, illustrates twelve major feasts of the Eastern Orthodox Church: the Annunciation, Nativity, Presentation of Christ in the Temple, Baptism of Christ, Raising of Lazarus, Entry into Jerusalem, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, Pentecost, Transfiguration, and Dormition of the Virgin. Above each scene is an ogival arch with an inscription identifying the composition. The frame must have been added by a Greek silversmith in the 18th or 19th century, since it has on its left side the Greek inscription \"of All Saints\", possibly referring to a Church of All Saints to which the icon was given as a gift.",
