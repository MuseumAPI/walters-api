    "Description": "Small portraits of those to whom one was connected by family, friendship, or political allegiance were treasured first as likenesses and second as works of art. Just as today, a \"good\" photo of someone is one that \"looks like\" the person. They were often given as gifts. They could be hung in a decorative arrangement or kept in a cabinet and taken out to be contemplated. Other fine miniature portraits at the Walters are 38.210, 38.516 and 38.209.",
