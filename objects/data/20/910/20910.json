    "Description": "This pendant, meant to prompt meditation as well as to provide ornamentation, takes the shape of the Crucifixion, with Mary and St. John on either side of Christ. The cross is represented as the Tree of Life, with a ruby set below Christ's feet. The ring at the top was for a chain to suspend the pendant, while that at the bottom was probably for a pearl, a common addition to many pendants of the time.",
