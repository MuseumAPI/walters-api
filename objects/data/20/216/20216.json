    "Description": "This large round platter depicts Alexander and Porus after the battle of Hydaspes. It is painted in grey-blue, olive-green, yellow, ochre and manganese. It has outlines in manganese. The marli is divided by tasseled cords into fourteen compartments decorated with trophies of war. Around the low vertical side is a waved ribbon. The center is filled by a battle scene: in the left foreground, the wounded Porus, bare-headed, is seated on the ground and supported by two of his officers. In the middle of the composition, Alexander stands turned towards Porus, holding his horse by the bridle. The background is of tangled soldiers on foot and horseback with a wall of spears behind. The back is white.",
