The lid, divided in the centre, has a chiselled decoration in low relief on a sanded ground. At top a ducal coronet is surmounted by curved vertical bans, arranged in paris, with designs of a trellis, birds under a baldachin, masks with festoons of drapery, busts of a woman (or a bearded man) in a medallion, all divided by swept lines terminating in acanthus foliage with heads of an eagle or a dragon. The exterior of the base is engraved with an elaborate heraldic achievement, a shield-of-arms. The coat-of-arms is that of James, first Duke of Chandos (1673-1744).",
