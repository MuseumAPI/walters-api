    "Description": "This stained glass panel featuring details inspired by 15th-century architecture was made for the central window of the choir in the Waasen Church in Leoben, Austria. A related fragment is in the Duke University Museum of Art (inv. 1978.20.7). The narrative panels in the window, now dispersed, represented scenes from the infancy of Christ (e.g. the Presentation in the Temple, now Los Angeles County Museum of Art, inv. 45.92). The style of the windows suggests they were made by a local workshop around 1415-25.",
