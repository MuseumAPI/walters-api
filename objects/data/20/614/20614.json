    "Description": "The Madonna stands on a wooden plinth with curving, ivory-veneered sides. She wears a crown over a mantle, holds lilies in her right hand, and gestures toward the Child, whom she carries in the crook of her arm. Christ's left hand rests on an orb which has lost its cross; his right hand is missing. One of the eight fleurons from the Virgin's crown has been broken, and her right hand is restored; her lilies and crown are separate pieces.",
