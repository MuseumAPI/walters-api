    "Description": "Two peasant women rest leaning on their rakes as the sun sets. Breton trained in Belgium and in Paris but remained committed to his birthplace, Courri\u00e8res in the Pas-de-Calais department of northern France. His early paintings reflect a concern for the plight for the rural poor, but his later works tended to romanticize their existence.",
