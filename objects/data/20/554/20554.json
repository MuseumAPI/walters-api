    "Description": "The horseman in the foreground of this painting wears the type of extravagant helmet associated with the Macedonian ruler-general Alexander the Great (356-323 BC), conqueror of Europe and Asia from the Aegean Sea to India and Afghanistan, as well as Greece and Egypt. Prints and paintings of his exploits were popular and validated Europeans' sense of destiny in seeking dominion over other cultures. Most Europeans did not know what India or Afghanistan looked like, so any vaguely rugged setting was suitable.",
