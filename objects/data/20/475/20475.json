    "Description": "This Armenian hymnal was created in the late-seventeenth or early eighteenth century. Although no colophons are recorded in the manuscript, the name of the scribe, Awet, appears on fol. 11r. This may be the same Awet whose work is recorded elsewhere in manuscripts produced at the Monastery of Surb Amenap'rkic in New Julfa, Isfahan (Iran). The four miniatures depicting Joachim and Anna, Adam and Eve, the Resurrection of Christ, and Pentecost represent familiarity with European pictorial traditions. They appear to have been retouched after the original paint began to flake off. The head-pieces for canon divisions and the marginal decoration are based on earlier Armenian models. The small size of this hymnal suggests that it was used privately when participating in the Armenian liturgy.",
