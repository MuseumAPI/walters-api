    "Description": "\"We slected this subject not because he was either a great warrior chief, or brave - in fact, he had no pretension to either distinction, but because it approached a classical form, and had a good artistic form about it.\"  A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
