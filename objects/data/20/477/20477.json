    "Description": "King David's son Amnon pretended to be sick, and, when his half-sister Tamar came to visit him, he treacherously raped her (2 Samuel). Later, once the athletic ideal of classical antiquity and contemporary Italian art had been absorbed in the Netherlands, painters would typically depict such threatening male figures with far more muscular builds. \r\n\r\nSetting the scene in a 16th-century bedroom with beautiful furnishings, including a wall clock (rare and expensive at this time) implied that the biblical stories remained current. The rich surface details and elaborate play of folds are typical of the prevailing style in Antwerp around 1515 to 1525.",
