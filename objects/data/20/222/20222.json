    "Description": "This plate with an overhanging edge is painted in blue, pale copper-green, yellow, ochre, manganese, grey, brown, blue-black and opaque white, and in gold and ruby lustre. At the left, a group of buildings is in flames. At the right, with one arm extended toward the fire is a seated warrior, crowned, and four companions. The man at the left wears a turban and holds a long battle axe. In the background are a town and water. The back is bluish-buff and is decorated on the marli with four spirals in ruby lustre converted into leaf scrolls by gold lustre additions. In the center is \"1534\" in pale ruby lustre.\r\n\r\nThe scene perhaps depicts the burning of Rome in the presence of Nero, or Alexander ordering the destruction of the Palace of Persepolis.",
