    "Description": "The man standing on the boat at the right of this tsuba is Kamatari, the founder of the powerful Fujiwara family. He was a historical figure who died in 669, but this episode is from a legend. His daughter had become the empress of China and sent a boatload of treasures, including a valuable jewel, back to Japan to be used for a temple. The Dragon King of the sea stole the jewel and hid it in his temple. Kamatari retrieved it with the help of a diver girl, who sacrificed herself to ensure the jewel was returned to Kamatari. On the tsuba, he is shown with the jewel after its return.",
