    "Description": "The enthroned king in the center of this hammered and carved bowl is flanked on the right by an attendant waving a fly whisk and on the left by a noble or princely figure holding a beaded diadem.  The ends of the bowl are adorned with dancing girls, whose long scarves fly backward toward the central scene. Although associated with silver vessels made in Iran during the Sassanian dynasty (AD 224-651), the vessel's shape and decoration suggest that this object dates from the early Islamic era.",
