It is called a mandala because it places Vasudhara in relationship to an array of deities. At top center appears Namasamgiti, flanked by cosmic Buddhas. (Namasamgiti is also the name of a popular text, \"Manjushri Namasamgiti,\" and the god is the text come alive.) The small figures in the side panels, many of them sprites (\"yaksha\"), are painted with extraordinary vigor.",
