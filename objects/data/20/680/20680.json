    "Description": "This image of the Virgin is the left panel of the triptych Deesis, a composition in which Christ is flanked by intercessors, chiefly his mother and John the Baptist. Here the Virgin turns toward what was once an image of Christ (compare Walters 44.375). On the reverse of the icon, on what would be the outside of the folded triptych, is a cross with the symbols of the four evangelists and a panorama of the city of Jerusalem.",
