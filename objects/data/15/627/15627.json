    "Description": "The figure wears a pointed cap and cloak and cradles a cluster of grapes and apples, distinguishing attributes that identify him as Autumn. The right arm, right leg, and left foot are broken off. Since no visible sign of attachment is preserved, the function of the figure is unclear. However, the manner in which the drapery and the figure's back form an angle, as seen from the rear, suggests that the piece once stood at the corner of a box or piece of furniture, perhaps together with representations of other seasons.",
