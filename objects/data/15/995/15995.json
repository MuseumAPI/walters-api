    "Description": "This painting, Walters manuscript leaf W.701, depicts Mullah Du Piyazah (Two Onions) riding an emaciated horse and dates to the middle of the 12th century AH/AD 18th. It was produced in India, perhaps Hyderabad. Mullah Du Piyazah, who features largely in folk verses and folk tales, was allegedly a jokester at the court of the third Mughal Emperor Akbar (949 AH/AD 1542-1014 AH/AD 1605). The witticisms of this character are directed at the Mughal elite, including Akbar himself. The painting is framed by a light green border with illuminated floral and fauna motifs.",
