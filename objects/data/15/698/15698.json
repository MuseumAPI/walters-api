    "Description": "This Gallican Psalter was created in the diocese of Constance, Southern Germany, in the first half of the thirteenth century. The psalms, which originally had an eight-part liturgical division, have been badly misbound, and approximately half of them are lost entirely. Extensively illuminated with over 100 historiated, inhabited, and decorated initials, the manuscript is impressive even in its fragmentary state. The saints found in the litany help locate the manuscript to Constance, and also suggest Cistercian use. That the manuscript was well used is attested to by late thirteenth-century additions of antiphons in the margins, as well as an added German meditation on the Passion of the same period.",
