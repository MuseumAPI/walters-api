    "Description": "This plaque together with its counterpart (44.133), each painted in \"sfumato grisaille,\" were surely from a series set into a casket. One of the commanding figures is identified as Hector, the most valiant of the Trojans in \"The Iliad,\" the Homeric epic chronicling the Greek conquest of Troy; so the overall theme may have been the Trojan War. The artist took motifs from an engraving after a composition by the Italian master Giulio Romano (1499-1546) that represented a military campaign of the Roman general Scipio Africanus.\r\n\r\nThe monogram \"KIP,\" found here, is thought to be that of Jean Poillev\u00e9.\r\n",
