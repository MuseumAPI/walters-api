    "Description": "The Virgin's simple garments and unadorned hair indicate her humility, and the halo of light radiating from her head testifies to her sanctity and purity. The regular shapes of the Virgin's features and the upturned gaze reveal Sassoferrato's study of the work of Guido Reni (1575-1642). Sassoferrato, however, uses more simplified forms than Reni, as well as a reduced color scheme. This simplicity of style was intended to convey piety. Some of the artist's renderings of the subject were meant as pendants, or companion paintings, to images of Christ as the Savior of the World (\"Salvator Mundi\"), following a northern European type.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 323, pp. 450-451.",
