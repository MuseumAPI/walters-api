    "Description": "Fran\u00e7ois was a pupil of Bonnat and Chapu. From 1867 he exhibited several cameos in various stones and at least one statuette at the Salon in Paris. The cameos included subjects such as \"Liberty,\" \"Saint George,\" and \"Prometheus,\" as well as several scenes featuring Venus. He was an officer of the Legion d'Honneur and some of his work can be found in the Luxembourg Museum, Paris.\r\n\r\nThis cameo shows a nude woman standing next to a branch with apples. In the bush next to her is a snake. She is Eve in the Garden of Eden. Fran\u00e7ois is known to have exhibited a onyx cameo with this subject at the Salon, it is not yet clear if this is that same cameo or a version of it.",
