    "Description": "Marguerite-Josephine Weimer (called Mademoiselle George), French actress, was born in Bayeaux in 1787. Her first stage appearance was in Amiens at the age of twelve. While admired for her beauty at her Paris debut in 1802, Weimer could not compete with Mademoiselle Duchenois, her well-established rival, and thus she performed abroad from 1808-1813. She is best remembered as the dramatic muse of the Romantics, especially Hugo and Dumas p\u00e8re. She died in Passy in 1867.",
