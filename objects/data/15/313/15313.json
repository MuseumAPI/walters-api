    "Description": "This image from Walters manuscript w.106 depicts a scene from the life of Christ. After his resurrection, Christ appeared to the apostles and his mother one final time. After he told them that the Holy Spirit would come upon them, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. While they were gazing into heaven, two men appeared and said \"Men of Galilee, Why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.\"",
