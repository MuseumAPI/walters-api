    "Description": "The most popular type of mirror in the Hellenistic period was of \"clamshell\" form, much like the modern compact. The polished mirror disk was protected by a hinged lid, decorated with figures in relief on the exterior and, not uncommonly, with a scene engraved on its underside. Appearing on the inside lid of this mirror is a tranquil scene with a nude maiden, perhaps Aphrodite or a nymph, bathing in a rocky grotto.",
