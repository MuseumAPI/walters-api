    "Description": "The body of this image has few individually articulated elements. The left arm does not rest on the body; it is, instead, a tapering tubular mass that culminates in the curved and magically floating fingers. The generalization of forms is akin to that seen in numerous standing images of the later centuries. Although a stiff puckering and forward projection of the lips can be observed on images made as early as the 16th century, it is also a trait found on images made much later. The possibility of a date considerably later than the 17th century can not be excluded.",
