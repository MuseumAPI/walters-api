    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.590 is a manuscript copy of al-Misbah al-munir fi gharib al-Sharh al-Kabir by Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Muqri al-Fayyumi (died ca. 770 AH/AD 1368). It is a dictionary of Islamic legal terms that was originally written as a gloss on the commentary of 'Abd al-Karim al-Rafi'i (died 623 AH/AD 1226) on al-Wajiz fi al-furu' by Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazzali (died 505 AH/AD 1111), entitled Fath al-'aziz 'al\u00e1 kitab al-Wajiz. The manuscript was copied by the shi`ite scribe 'Ali ibn Muhibb 'Ali in 1083 AH/AD 1673 in Iran. The text was later collated with three other manuscripts in Mecca in 1166 AH/AD 1752 by Muhammad al-Atrabazundi. The light brown goatskin binding with gold-tooled oval central medallion, pendants, and cornerpieces is contemporary with the manuscript.",
