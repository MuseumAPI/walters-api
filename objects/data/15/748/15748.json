    "Description": "Walters manuscript W.627 is an illustrated copy of the well-known poem recounting the platonic love story between Mihr (the Sun), the son of Shahpur, and his vizier's son Mushtari (Jupiter). The story of 90 chapters was composed by Muhammad ibn Ahmad \"Assar Tabrizi (died 784 AH/AD 1382). The present copy was written in Nasta\"liq script by Murshid al-Katib in 881 AH/AD 1476. Considering the number of surviving manuscripts in which this calligrapher's name is found, it seems he was particularly prolific. The present codex is illustrated with 9 paintings. The gold-brushed leather binding with doublures of red leather decorated with filigree work is original to the manuscript.",
