    "Description": "After the departure of the wise men, the Gospel of Matthew reports that an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and warned him to take Mary and Jesus and flee to safety in Egypt. Here, they are guided by an angel through what should be an arid desert or wilderness but is more like the countryside near Antwerp. Jordaens may not have known-or cared-what desert terrain looked like, but his flamboyant vegetation lends baroque drama to the moment and is typical of the artist who followed in importance only Rubens and Van Dyck among Flemish painters of his time.",
