    "Description": "This bronze relief was made for a private, devotional setting.  It represents a \"sacra conversazione\" (literally \"holy conversation\"), showing the Virgin and Child flanked by two saints.  The slightly awkward style, with its mixture of old-fashioned and new elements (the stiff lion and the lack of perspective on one hand and the novelty of the classical shape of the Virgin's throne on the other) is similar to that of the huge bronze doors for St. Peter's in Rome, created between 1433 and 1445 by the Florentine sculptor, architect, and theorist Antonio Averlino, known as Filarete.",
