    "Description": "In the 19th or early 20th century a modern engraver embellished the panels with scenes taken from the antique. The figures on this panel are derived from ancient statues and include Pan, Apollo, Dionysos, and Herakles.\r\n\r\nThis panel was broken vertically and repaired. The top of this panel has broken, but two-thirds is preserved and has been reattached. The ancient upper edge has two grooves. The back surface is also grooved at the top and bottom, the bottom groove to retain the floor of the box, the top to accommodate a sliding lid. This panel, with Walters 71.500 forms two adjacent sides of a box; the ends are mortised and can be snugly dovetailed together.",
