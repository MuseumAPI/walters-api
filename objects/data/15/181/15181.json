    "Description": "This scene shows the episode that triggered the Trojan War and ended with the destruction of Troy. The goddess Venus promised the Trojan prince Paris that he could marry Helen, the most beautiful of mortal women. Unfortunately, she was already married to the king of Sparta. Helen had gone to the island of Cythera to worship Venus when she was abducted by Paris and taken to his waiting ships. (See the famous painting of this subject by Heemskerck in the Chamber of Wonders on Level 2.) The fine ornaments with fantastic creatures and cameos along the rim are the painter's attempt to imitate the pictorial style of classical antiquity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
