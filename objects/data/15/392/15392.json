    "Description": "Fish were not only a major staple in the diet of the ancient Egyptians, but many species were also related to gods. This exceptional fish pendant depicts a \"Tilapia nilotica,\" a common species in the Nile. It was appreciated for its taste, and was also regarded as a symbol of rebirth and resurrection because it carries its eggs in its mouth and was, therefore, believed to be self-created. Carnelian was very popular in the New Kingdom and was used especially for rings, pendants, and other items of jewelry.",
