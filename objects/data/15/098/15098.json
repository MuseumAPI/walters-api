    "Description": "Paintings of \"beauties,\" women from the highest circles who were celebrated for their allure, were found in many contemporary collections belonging to the elite, especially among courtiers in The Hague, Netscher's most important clients. The portraits were often informal and might be duplicated. This is a version of a painting dated 1679 in a German private collection.\r\n\r\nThe richly dressed young woman is making a garland of flowers, presumably to crown her beloved. The loosened top of her undergarment is provocatively revealing: she has more to offer than a crown of flowers.\r\n",
