    "Description": "The intricate gold and enamel filigree collar and diamond pendant are quite fine, but it is the embroidered bodice and ruff of exquisite needlepoint in the Spanish style that really speak to this noblewoman's wealth and sense of fashion. The ruff is similar to that worn by Archduchess Isabella in \"The Archdukes Visiting a Collector's Cabinet\" (Walters 37.2010).\r\n\r\nPourbus was a superb portraitist of the aristocracy. He was active at several courts including that of the Archdukes in Brussels. After 1609 he settled in Paris, working for Marie de' Medici, widow of Henry IV, and her court, of which this noblewoman was probably a member.",
