    "Description": "The naive treatment of this crucifix suggests a provincial, perhaps Philippine, origin. Disregard for anatomical exactitude is apparent in the rendering of the attenuated torso and the bowed legs. The spindly arms have been carved separately and attached. The cloth falls in schematized folds around the loins. \r\n\r\nThe Walters crucifix has suffered damage most notably in the hands; three fingers have been broken on the figure's right hand and all five on the left. A large hole drilled in the head may have contained a dowel for attaching a halo. Also, although no traces survive other than the tinting of the hair, the figure originally  may have been polychromed.",
