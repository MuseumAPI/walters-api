    "Description": "This paten is one of twenty-three silver altar vessels (formerly known as the \"Hama Treasure\") believed to have been found in the Syrian village of Kurin (the Greek form of the name is Kaper Koraon).  These altar vessels form part of The Walters' rich holdings in Byzantine silver. Although as archbishop, Amphilochios, the donor of this paten enjoyed high social status, his gift is among the least pretentious of the Kaper Koraon vessels although it is one of the largest and heaviest patens from this group.",
