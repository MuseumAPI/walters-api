He became an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1867, and the next year painted Napoleon III's portrait. He was also a leading teacher of the \u00e9cole des Beaux-Arts from 1863-83.  The French emperor is shown in his prime, two years before the defeat of his forces in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871).\r\n",
