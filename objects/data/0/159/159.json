    "Description": "A three clawed dragon consuming the sacred fungi lingzhi, believed to ensure long life and used as a symbol for immortality, is painted in underglaze cobalt blue on this rounded jar. The dragon is surrounded by the mystical mushrooms as it flies along the outside of the vessel. Jars of this type are identified as water pots used by scholars on a writing desk. The rounded crisp mouth is a functional design which assists in removing excess water from a brush. On the foot is inscribed a mark for good luck, translated \"precious jade treasure\". \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
