    "Description": "This unidentified gentleman is dressed in the sober style of the French court around 1550-70. The suggestion of soft velvet, the definition of the hair, the shadow that sets off the profile of the face from the background, and the parapet with a swag pattern are features of the work of L\u00e9onard Limosin and his workshop during these years. Limosin was one of the most successful artists working in painted enamel for the French court and the only one who made portraiture a specialty. Painted enamel portraits were more durable than those in tempera or oil.",
