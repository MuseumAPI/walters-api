    "Description": "In the strong, harsh light, the naked, sleeping baby Jesus appears alarmingly vulnerable yet monumentally imposing, in contrast to the tiny figures of his mother and St. Joseph in the background. The death-like state of his sleep points to his future Passion and death, while the white cloth on which he lies is meant to bring to mind his shroud. \t\r\n\r\nSchedoni's curiously tender yet brutal naturalism owes much to the extended influence of Caravaggio's painting style, even though the artist may never have actually met him. Schedoni often had copies made of his works. This painting, of which several versions exist, was probably painted by an assistant.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 264, pp. 389-390.",
