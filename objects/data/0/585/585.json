Peter, Paul, and two archangels. Surrounding them is a rich, gilt silver revetment (cover), densely patterned with scrolls and leaves. This vividly colored icon forms the center of a Deesis, a composition in which the figure of Christ is flanked by panels of the Virgin on the left and John the Baptist on the right.",
