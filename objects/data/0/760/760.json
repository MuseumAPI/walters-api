    "Description": "The story of Daphne is told by the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC-AD 17) in \"The Metamorphoses.\" Cupid, god of love, shot the god Apollo with a gold-tipped arrow, kindling his love for the nymph Daphne, but Cupid shot her with one tipped with lead, stifling love.  Pursued by Apollo, Daphne prayed to her father, a river god, to save her, and she was transformed into a laurel tree.\r\n\r\nOvid's tales were popular for their eroticism.  In addition, the idea of metamorphosis, a fundamental, divinely sanctioned change of state, offered a way of thinking about the creative act, as in the transformation of a chunk of copper ore into a bronze statuette.\r\n\r\nJacques Laudin, who monogrammed this plaque, adapted the composition from an engraving of 1589 after a drawing by the Dutch artist Hendrick Goltzius.  The frame is original.",
