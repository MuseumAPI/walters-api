    "Description": "Trading and exchange between China and the Portuguese began after Manuel I established an embassy at Beijing in 1517. From then on, blue and white porcelain was exported to Portugal and more broadly Europe. Chinese wares produced specifically for the purpose of export also included personal commissions. \r\n\r\nThis bottle is one of six known \"Jorge \u00c1lvares bottles,\" named for the Portuguese naval captain and merchant that purchased them. \u00c1lvares was also known to be a friend to St. Frances Xavier, a Jesuit missionary in China and throughout the Asian continent. The inscription around the shoulder of the bottle, written upside-down in imitation of a Portuguese model, is translated as \"Jorge Alvrz (\u00c1lvares) had this made at the time of 1552 [reign of King John III].\" The base reads \"wan fu you tong\" translated roughly as \"may infinite happiness come to this place.\" The cobalt blue painting in the outline and wash technique depicts the 16th century Buddhist motif of lions playing with brocaded balls. Beneath, along the curved base, are more balls with waving tassels. Ornamental chains and geometric flowers adorn the lower half of the neck while the flared mouth is painted with pointed plantain leaves. Other examples of the \u00c1lvares bottles include paintings of aquatic, terrestrial, and fantastic flora and fauna. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial porcelain.\r\n",
