    "Description": "A work of art and a triumph of technology, the long-tailed sallet was the characteristic German war helmet of the later Middle Ages. This is a superb example. The flowing profile of the neck defense and mirror-like polish of the hammered, tempered steel could deflect the most formidable blows. The visor could be raised to provide better vision and easier breathing. It would have been used with a chin guard. Its weight at 4 lbs. 12 oz. is considerably less than that of its Italian counterpart.\r\n\r\nThis sallet is from the Princes of Liechtenstein collection at Vaduz.\r\n",
