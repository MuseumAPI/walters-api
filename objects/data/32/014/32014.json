    "Description": "The composition includes many figures, according to a tradition established by the 14th-century formulation of the Crucifixion in Sienese painting. Mounted officials and foot-soldiers mingle in a dense throng, above which rise the three crosses. The drawing of Christ is of great beauty and reminds one of a Florentine Corpus of the Quattrocento. In the foreground at the foot of the cross is the group of holy women huddled around the swooning Virgin, watched by St. John. This is also remarkably executed. The diagonal position of the crucified thieves fits well into the roundel. An angel in gold hovers near the Good Thief, on Christ's right, and a demon is drawn in grisaille above the Bad Thief. Near the Centurion, a gilt scroll soars upward inscribed: VERE FILIVS DEI ERAT ISTE. Below the horse on the right an open scroll bears the monogram KIP.",
