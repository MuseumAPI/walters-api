    "Description": "This splendid ring is a variation on the popular celestial theme of late 18th- and early 19th-century rings. Its bezel consists of individual diamonds mounted at evenly spaced intervals against a blue enamel background creating an allusion to the stars in the night sky. Rings in this syle were commonly called \"bagues au firmament\" (Rings of the Heavens). This ring exemplifies a popular bezel shape of the period: the oval, or \"marquises.\" Close-set diamond sparks along the borders outline the central design to create a dazzling effect.",
