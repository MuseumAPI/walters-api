    "Description": "A morion is a light helmet for soldiers on foot or horseback with a distinctive comb along the top and an upturned brim. They are decorated with studs and often with etching, paint, and gilding. The image on this one represents the legendary Roman nobleman Marcus Curtius. When a chasm opened up in the center of ancient Rome, it was believed that it would not close until something of great value was thrown into it. The warrior sacrificed his life to protect Rome by riding his horse into the chasm, which then closed over them.\r\n\r\nThis morion was worn by a member of the bodyguard of the electors of Saxony in Dresden. The archduke of Saxony was one of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire who had a vote in the election of the emperor. \r\n",
