    "Description": "The man kneeling at the lower right of this tsuba is K\u00f4sagi, one of the Japanese paragons of filial piety. He worked hard every day to ensure there was enough money to buy his father some sake. When times became hard, he was unable to afford the sake despite his hard work. When he was collecting water at a stream, the gods revealed to him a waterfall which they turned into sake. K\u00f4sagi is often depicted with a noble man, here shown standing behind him. K\u00f4sagi holds the gourd he is about to fill with sake. The waterfall is at the lower left, with bamboo leaves on the banks. On the reverse of the tsuba is a scene of mountains and a pine tree.",
