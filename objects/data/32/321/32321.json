    "Description": "Jean Petitot was a major French portraitist in painted enamel who learned the technique from Henri Toutin. His enamels, with their refined detailing, soft modeling, and polished surfaces, suited the court's taste and had many imitators. Prieur studied with Petitot, but his style is slightly more naturalistic.",
