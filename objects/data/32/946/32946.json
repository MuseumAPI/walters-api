    "Description": "Lekythoi, often used in funerary rituals and found in burials, commonly show scenes of daily life or funerary themes. Here, three young men are depicted preparing for battle. The central figure plays a trumpet, which, though rarely depicted on pottery, was commonly used to help keep time while marching. The two warriors are armed with spears and carry heavy shields, called \"hoploi,\" from which the term hoplite, or foot soldier, is derived.",
