    "Description": "The haloes of both the Virgin and Child are missing, and the back of the Virgin's head is damaged. Nevertheless, the subtle working of the silver to create the drapery and the use of gilding for the Virgin's hair result in an object that would have been cherished both as a devotional statuette in a wealthy home and as an exquisite work of art. While the technical aspects of the piece suggest that it was created in the Champagne region of France, treatment of the Virgin's face shows that the artist was familiar with Netherlandish painting.",
