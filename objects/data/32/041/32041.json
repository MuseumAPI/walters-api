    "Description": "This tankard is one of a pair in the Walters collection made for export to Holland by way of the Dutch East India Companies. The white body has slightly bowed sides and a handle, which are painted with underglaze cobalt blue decorations. A river landscape includes a grazing horse attended by a man beneath a willow tree. Scrolling clouds surround the base and the upper rim is decorated with a band of chrysanthemum. A silver lid engraved with a crest was mounted to the porcelain in Europe.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen caused an influx of porcelain artists to begin private practice at private kilns during the Transitional period (1620-1683) between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Manchu occupation of China also shut down most of the imperial kilns. Private kilns produced functional and economic shapes, painted with naturalist subjects (human figures, animals, landscapes) based on wood block illustrations from novels. Private patrons could acquire porcelains of high quality through private kilns, where landscape painting is revived for these patrons. Export porcelains continued to ship to European and Japanese markets. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. \r\n",
