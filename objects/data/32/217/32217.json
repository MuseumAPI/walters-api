    "Description": "This prayer book was written in Dutch ca. 1475. It is notable for its full-page miniature introducing the prayers, which represents a clock containing the crown of thorns, centered between the names of Christ and the Virgin in gold and blue. Reference to the mystical meaning of the clock is found in the manuscript, which contains Henry Suso's text of the clock of the eternal wisdom.",
