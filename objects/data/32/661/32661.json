    "Description": "The rats on this kozuka are dressed like samurai of the Edo period. On the front, one rat leads another who is carrying a ceremonial pole used to indicate the presence of a high-ranking person such as a daimyo. At the right is a third rat. The procession continues on the reverse, with an incised scene of many rats surrounding a palanquin. Daimyo processions were common between Edo and the regional capitals of Japan being in the early 17th century. Daimyo warlords were required to live in Edo alternating with periods of residence in their home prefecture. They moved between their two homes in large processions attended by many warriors.",
