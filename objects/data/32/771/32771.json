    "Description": "Ren\u00e9 Lalique revolutionized jewelry design by combining precious and non-precious materials selected according to their aesthetic appeal.  By 1904, the year that he exhibited this necklace at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, Lalique had progressed beyond Art Nouveau, the movement with which he was originally associated. He began emphasizing compositions with symmetrical components and the use of animal motifs in a style that would become fully manifested in the designs he created for molded glass several years later.\r\n",
