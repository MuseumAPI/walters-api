    "Description": "This tall trumpet shaped vessel in the shape of an ancient bronze Gu has a thin body divided by a central bulge and topped with an exaggerated flare. A Gu was a ceremonial vessel for wine or ritual libations and this underglaze blue and white porcelain variety would have also been an appropriate object in an altar set or as a vase. Lotus blossoms and spiked leaves are painted as a uniform decoration in cobalt blue. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques, emulating watercolor on paper. The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty were also preoccupied with ancient Chinese culture, utilizing traditional shapes, designs, and glazes of the Song and Ming dynasties. \r\n",
