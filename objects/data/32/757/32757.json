    "Description": "The figure of Christ is fastened to the Cross by blackened nails driven into the hands and feet. Christ's head is tilted and turned somewhat to the left, the same direction in which the body falls. The loincloth is knotted on the right, and a swag is looped to cover the groin. Above is the \"titulus,\" with the inscription INRI; below is an Adam's skull and one tibia.\r\n\r\nThe general composition suggests an 18th-century prototype, whereas such traits as the slight body, the restrained, sentimental facial expression, and the superficial treatment of the lance woulnd indicate a late 19th-century date.",
