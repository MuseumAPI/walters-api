    "Description": "The Pharisees tried to trap Christ by asking him whether people should pay taxes to the Romans. Pointing to a denarius (Roman coin with the image of the emperor), he replied: \"Give to the emperor the things that are the emperor's, and to God the things that are God's\" (Mark 12:17).\r\n\r\nFetti painted this work while court artist to the Gonzagas, the ruling family of Mantua, as a copy of a painting by Titian (ca. 1490-1576), famous for his use of impasto (strokes of thick oil paint). Fetti also imitated Titian's signature on the neck of the Pharisee's shirt. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 313, pp. 441-442.",
