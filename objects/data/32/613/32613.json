    "Description": "Stamps and seals indicating ownership or manufacture were very important during the Early Byzantine period. Artisans and merchants applied stamps to their products, and people used them in homes to secure closets and chests. The loops on the back allowed the stamps to be worn as rings, making them always available. The Greek inscription on this example translates as \"Drink Good Wine\". It was used to seal large casks of wine.",
