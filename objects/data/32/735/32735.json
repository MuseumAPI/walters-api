    "Description": "The Virgin Mary holds the Christ Child and is flanked by two angels and Saints Jerome and Bernardino of Siena. Bernardino (1380-1444) holds up a tablet with a monogram of the name of Christ. The monogram is partly covered by Jesus' head to show us its true meaning.\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic modeling of the figures and their overlapping spatial arrangement reveal Matteo di Giovanni's mastery of the new way of creating pictorial space. At the same time, as a tribute to his native city, he includes the traditional Sienese gold ground of earlier centuries.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 83, p. 127.\r\n",
