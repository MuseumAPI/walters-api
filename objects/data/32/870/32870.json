The youth on the left is crowned by his lady while the right-hand pair embrace. Kneeling figures are shown on the battlements on eigher side of the God of Love. The men wear capes and hoods over the \"cote-hardis;\" the \"cote-hardis\" of the women have liripipes at the elbows. The circular format is brought to a square with triangles of leaves at the corners, incised with veins. The carving is very rough in quality.",
