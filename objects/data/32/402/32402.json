    "Description": "The Latin inscription along the edge of the medal indicates that Gianello (1500-1585) was a clockmaker and architect from the city of Cremona.  One of his contemporaries described him as a \"bull in human form,\" and his rough features in this medal reflect this characterization.  A collector of timepieces would have been thrilled to have a portrait of a prominent clockmaker.\r\n\r\nThis medal was produced before Jacopo da Trezzo left Milan (near Cremona) in 1555 for the Southern Netherlands to enter the service of King Philip II of Spain. \r\n",
