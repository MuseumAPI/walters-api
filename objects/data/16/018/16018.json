    "Description": "This bracelet, consisting of two tubular pieces of sheet metal, was first photographed ca. 1912 with a number of other objects (the present Metropolitan Museum of Art, inv. 47.100.33 and Berlin, Staatliche Museen, Antikensammlung, Inv. 30099 among them) that probably come from a single wealthy woman's burial and are datable ca. 250-350 AD. This implies a 4th-century date for the piece. However, its clasp, composed of a small hinged section secured by a pin, is unusual for this period.",
