    "Description": "Originally this ivory plaque was the back for a disk-shaped mirror of polished metal. It is carved with a scene of the Fountain of Youth. Elderly men and women walk or travel by cart from the left to the mythical Fountain of Youth at the right. They bathe and reemerge as young couples who enter into the castle at the center and court above upon the battlements. The frame, a circle within a square, has four crouched dragon-like creatures in each corner.",
