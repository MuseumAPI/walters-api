    "Description": "In later life, Solomon, the Old Testament king famous for his wisdom, fell under the influence of his 700 foreign wives and turned to idolatry, building temples for their gods (1 Kings). This plaque and its companion \"Jael Killing Sisera\" are from a series \"The Power of Women,\" based on engravings of around 1569, published in Antwerp by Philips Galle (1537-1612). Other subjects include Eve offering the Apple to Adam, Delilah Cutting Sampson's Hair, and Judith Killing Holofernes. The women are represented as using their sexuality to control men. The series mixes the heroic and the tawdry, making little concession to the exemplary bravery and achievements of Judith or Jahel. An example of social \"backlash,\" the series was popular only where middle-class women had gained greater access to education and legal rights.\r\n\r\nPierre Reymond, who monogrammed the plaques, is known for sophisticated painted enamel display tableware.",
