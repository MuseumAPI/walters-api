    "Description": "Stripped and bound, Sebastian, a Roman soldier martyred for his Christian faith, strains against pain as the arrows of his tormentors pierce his body. The pathos of the figure is heightened by the forced vulnerability of this naturally tough soldier, conveyed through realistic, incredibly precise detailing, for example the thin ropes tightly binding his hands, which unclench as his body weakens. The tree provides a suggestion of setting as well as structural support.",
