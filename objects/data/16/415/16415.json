    "Description": "The morse is of quatrefoil form, with two bishops beneath trefoil arches shown against a field of blue enamel with copper flowers with red enamel centers. The bishops flank the Virgin and Child on the central narrow plate which swivels on the connecting pin. The bishops are surrounded by a series of monsters and grotesques in copper reverse against a red ground. Four cut rivets at the corners were used for attachment and most have been capped with cabochon jewels or other ornaments which have been lost.",
