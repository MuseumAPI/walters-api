    "Description": "This grouping of the Virgin and Child with saints (Mary Magdalene, Jerome, an unidentified saint, and Sebastian) is known as a \"sacra conversazione\" (sacred conversation). Even though the figures are outdoors, a brocade drapery hangs down behind Mary and Jesus to mark their status as King and Queen of Heaven. The Lamb of God held by Christ is a symbol of his future sacrifice. This type of horizontal composition with half-length figures before a tranquil landscape was popular in northern Italian painting.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 149, pp. 222-223.",
