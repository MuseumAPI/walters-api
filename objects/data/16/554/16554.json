    "Description": "In this pastel, Cassatt portrays the 12-year-old son of her friend and art consultant Dikran Kelekian. From 1866 to 1870, Cassatt studied in Paris with such masters as Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me and Thomas Couture, but, becoming aware of the works of Gustave Courbet and Edgar Degas, she broke with the academic traditions. In 1879, when she had developed a fully impressionistic style, Degas invited her to participate in the 4th impressionist exhibition. At that time, she also began to produce major works in pastel, drawing with remarkably vigorous and intense strokes.\r\n",
