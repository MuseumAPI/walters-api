    "Description": "This is one of three large panels (also 37.1178 and 37.1179) depicting the romance of Helen, queen of the Greek city state Sparta, and Paris, a Trojan prince. The location of the present scene is Cythera, an island dedicated to Aphrodite (better known by her Roman name Venus), goddess of love. A party of courtiers from Sparta (where Paris was a guest) have come to the island on an excursion while Menelaus, king of Sparta is away on business. It was in the temple of Aphrodite (at the left) that Paris and Helen met and he convinces her to come away with him to his home city of Troy. For more on this series, see 37.1178. The series is being conserved for installation.\r\nWhile there are other panels by the same artist, his identity remains under discussion. See further the description for 37.1178\r\n\r\n",
