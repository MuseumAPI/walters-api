    "Description": "\"Some rocks are strange and eccentric,\r\n\t\tformed by nature's cuts,\r\nsome grasses are young and tender,\r\n\t\tgreen from winter to summer\"\r\n\r\nbegins Zhangqi's [Chang Ch'i's] long poem. The large rock and the planter must be imagined sitting \"before a clear window on an uncluttered desk.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the poem is devoted to the praise of the \"divine sprouts\" of the calamus growing in the planter. Its leaves are hung over doorways at the time of the annual dragonboat festival, and its dried rootlets have numerous medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nThe seals Zhangqi [Chang Ch'i] impressed upon his painting suggest something of his character. They read, \"Having no worldly desires\" and \"Mountain master of vegetable roots.\"\r\n",
