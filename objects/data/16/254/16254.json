    "Description": "Hall left Sweden for France in 1766.  Within three years, he was officially a painter to King Louis XVI.  Hall introduced to French miniature painting a seemingly spontaneous technique employing broad, loose brushstrokes. \r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette of Lorraine (1755-93) married Louis XVI in 1770 and shared her husband's fate in 1793.\r\n\r\nAt the time of accession this miniature was attributed to Hall, however, as the style is rather more precise than his typical work it may be by another artist or a follower of Hall. The case is later than the miniature appears to be.",
