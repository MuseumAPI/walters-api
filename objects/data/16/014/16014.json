    "Description": "The body of this piece is constructed of a pattern of interlocking circles. The incised lines at the intersection of vertical and horizontal elements create thirteen small crosses out of the interlaced design of the body. Three larger crosses spring forth at the top and terminal ends of the cross, defining the cruciform shape of the entire object. The complicated interlace design is found in Ethiopian manuscript illumination associated with the Stephanite order at the end of the 15th century.",
