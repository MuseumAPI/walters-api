    "Description": "The dead Christ is held up for the viewer's meditation and mourned by his mother, St. John the Evangelist, and an angel.  Moderno suggests Christ's heroic nature by depicting his body according to the ancient athletic ideal.  Such devotional plaques were also admired as art objects for the originality and beauty of the composition.  Among Moderno's patrons was the ducal family of Mantua in northern Italy.",
