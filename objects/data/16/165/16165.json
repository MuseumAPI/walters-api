    "Description": "The young beggars play musical instruments and sing in the street of an Italian town. Their poverty is realistic, as are their surroundings. While in the later 1600s there was increasing interest in the depiction of the poor, often for their \"picturesque\" qualities, in paintings to be purchased by the affluent, the particular approach and style seen here are characteristic of the artist, Pasquale de' Rossi (1641-1725). The artist primarily worked in Rome. The painting was at one time thought to be Spanish and attributed to Pedro Nu\u00f1ez de Villavicencio (1635-1700) or Bartolom\u00e9 Est\u00e9ban Murillo (1617-1682). For more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue, \"Italian Paintings in the Walters Art Gallery,\" vol. II, no. 337, p. 462.",
