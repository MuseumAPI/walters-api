    "Description": "The old brahmin Jujaka is poor but has a young, beautiful wife named Amittatapana. When Amittatapana goes to fetch water, the village women mock her for being married to an old man. She pleads with Jujaka to ask Vessantara for his children so that they can come and do her work, and she threatens to leave her husband unless her wish is granted. Amittatapana is seen getting teased and then returning to tell Jujaka her demand. Jujaka is also depicted twice: sitting in his small house and receiving the water from his wife.",
