    "Description": "This vase's cylindrical body and flared neck depict nine lions total playing with brocaded balls with waving tassels, a reoccurring subject of Chinese Buddhism. The sky is spotted with scrolling flames as the lions are supported on the banks of scrolled clouds. The slopped shoulders that separate the groups of lions are painted with clouds, traversed by five flying bats which symbolize happiness. An inverted foot is decorated with white plum blossoms on a blue ground. Soft tone blues are applied in the outline and wash technique creating clearly defined brush strokes on the lions and a dappled texture to the clouds. The porcelain is of a white soft paste. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
