    "Description": "Originally mounted as a screen to cover a fireplace during warm weather, in this exotic painting the artist has transformed the hearth into a miniature stage.  Three fanciful Chinese characters hold aloft a circular screen on which is depicted the mythological story of Zeus showering Dana\u00eb with gold.  A pair of figures, painted in grisaille on the side wall, incise their names on a tree trunk, a motif symbolizing eternal love.  The fire screen is the earliest recorded work of Vigoureux Duplessis, an artist who was associated with decorative projects for the Paris Opera, the Royal Academy of Music, and the Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory.",
