He traveled extensively, producing watercolors which were reproduced in deluxe \"travel books,\" such as \"Gondola Days\" (1897) and \"The Venice of To-Day\" (1897) as well as various magazines. He was also the author of many popular books.\r\n\r\nThe artist regarded this view of the Grand Canal showing the 17th-century church, Santa Maria della Salute, as one of his masterpieces.\r\n",
