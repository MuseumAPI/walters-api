    "Description": "It is unfortunate that this small but superbly modeled and carefully finished figure, representing an unidentified deity, is now fragmentary.  It fits well into the Borommatrailokanat period, about the 3rd quarter of the 15th century.  The elaborate clothing, probably ultimately derived from southern Indian or Sri Lankan court fashion, incorporates a variety of sashes and pendants that characterize later Burmese and Thai court dress and remain alive even now on dance and theatrical costumes.",
