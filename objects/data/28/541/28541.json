    "Description": "The Roman \"Campagna\" was the countryside around Rome. From the 17th century, it had been a favored subject for the depiction of an idealized, timeless world inhabited by nymphs and shepherds. Jan Frans van Bloemen, a Flemish painter who settled in Rome and specialized in landscapes, painted such subjects. The costumes of the figures are suggestive of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 394, p. 508.",
