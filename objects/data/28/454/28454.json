    "Description": "This red-figure kalpis depicts a mistress, a maid, and Eros. In the center a woman (mistress) sits on a klismos in profile to the right, extending her arms toward Eros who flies in from the right. In each hand she holds an oval-shaped object (fruit or egg), and a ribbon in white, now mostly lost, is draped across her arms. She wears a chiton and mantle, and her hair is held in place by ribbons. Eros has a fillet, holds a small chest up in his right hand, and carries a clump of sprigs in his lowered left hand. On the left another woman stands in profile to the right, looking into a mirror that she holds up in her right hand. She wears an ungirded chiton decorated with two vertical stripes, and her hair is held in place by ribbons.\r\n\r\nScenes with a centrally seated woman and flanking figures to either side are common both at this time and with this painter.\r\n\r\nThis is the only Attic red-figure vase known to have come from Castel Campanile, a site near Caere excavated in 1837.",
