    "Description": "This self-portrait provides a lively, flattering image of a man who was not known for his good looks.\r\n\r\nDuring the first third of the 19th century, Jarvis was America's most fashionable portrait painter. He was based in New York but frequently traveled south to serve his wealthy clientele. This self-portrait was first shown at Peale's Baltimore Museum in 1822. Subsequently, it was owned by Baltimorean Robert Gilmor, Jr. (1774-1848), one of America's first major art collectors.\r\n",
