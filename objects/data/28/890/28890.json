    "Description": "A nude female with drapery falling behind her holds a basket. A partridge is shown below within a square.\r\n\r\nThe plaque is semicircular in section and was dyed and is now a warm buff color. It has been broken in half and repaired. Several small sections are lost. There are four original holes for attachment, probably to a piece of furniture. Although from the same object as Walters 71.42, it is of a different color.\r\n\r\nThe partridge often appears in Coptic textiles.",
