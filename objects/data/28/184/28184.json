    "Description": "Wandering in the forest as he tries to find Vessantara, Jujaka is chased up a tree by dogs. He calls out and is heard by a hunter, who is in the forest to protect Vessantara and his family. Jujaka conceals his true intentions and tells the hunter that he is going to pay Vessantara a visit. The hunter then points Jujaka in the right direction. The many birds in the background are a Thai convention for representing a forest.",
