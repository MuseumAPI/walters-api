    "Description": "This vase is recognized as one of the rarest peach bloom porcelains produced by the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen during the reign of Kangxi (1662-1722). It is an example of panlong ping, or coiled dragon vase. No more than seven examples of panlong ping are known. The dragon for which the vase is named is modeled in full undercut relief, coiling around the slightly inclined shoulders at the base of a long cylindrical neck. It opens its mouth and digs its claws into the vase beneath it. A bright green uniform glaze covering the serpentine dragon contrasts vividly with the copper-red peach bloom glaze covering the vase. Apple red dapples the deep red-pink glaze and flashes of apple green are dispersed sparingly on the body and beneath the clear white rim. Overall, the vase presents an elegant verticality and playful nature with the inclusion of a lively and colorful dragon. \r\n\r\nWhile the French term peau de p\u00eache (\"peach skin\") has influenced the English interpretation of the glaze as emulating a ripened peach, Chinese interpretation of the spotted red-green surface favors the apple with descriptions such as pingguo hong (\"apple red\") and pingguo jing (\"apple green\"). The glaze's spotted appearance required the innovative technique of blowing a copper-oxide glaze onto a clear glaze; it would then be trapped by a second layer of transparent glaze. As a result of inconsistent application of copper, areas which are thicker penetrate the most superficial glaze allowing the copper to oxidize and form green clouds. The pinkish-red spotting is also a result of a blown-on glaze.   \r\n",
