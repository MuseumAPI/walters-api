    "Description": "Both the lid and container of this bonbonni\u00e8re, or sweet-meat container, have central circular fields and radiating panels carved in relief. On the cover, a seated nude woman caresses a dog; on the container itself, a shepherd holding a crook pats his dog. The shallowly and rather summarily rendered radiating panels show vignettes with shepherds, shepherdesses, watchdogs, and sheep. A narrow frieze running around the side of the container illustrates a boar hunt.\r\n\r\nThe two sections of the bonbonni\u00e8re are attached by a gilt-metal hinge. A hole in the rim opposite the hinge indicates that the box may also have had a metal clasp.\r\n\r\nIncised and blackened in the inside of the container is an owner's monogram, MT. The cover bears a paper label: MACKAY & CHISHOLM/GOLSMITHS./57 Princess Street/EDINBURGH.",
