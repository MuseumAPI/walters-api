    "Description": "The Master K.I.P. is known to us only by his signed initials, his actual identity remaining unclear. His work reveals the direct influence of Italian models-this composition being copied after an engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, who in turn copied a painting by Raphael. A pax was a liturgical object which was kissed by the celebrating priest and then passed among the congregation during the Mass.",
