    "Description": "On the front appears the royal ch\u00e2teau and park at Fontainebleau. The building began as a royal hunting lodge in the early 12th century but was substantially rebuilt over time, particularly at the beginning of the 17th century. In the background is the Fontainebleau forest, a favorite location for landscape painters. On the reverse is a view of the interior of the forest. During the Second Empire (1852-1870), the state-sponsored porcelain factory that had been founded at S\u00e8vres in the mid 18th century continued to determine stylistic trends and technical innovations for the French ceramic industry. A number of the artists whom it employed as decorators eventually became major landscape painters. This monumental vase, with its unusual turquoise background color, described as \"vert clair\" (clear green) in the factory records, was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle and sold to William T. Walters for 5,300 French francs ($1,100), a remarkable sum at the time.\r\n",
