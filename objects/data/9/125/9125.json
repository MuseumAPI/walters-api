    "Description": "This box has an image of the Deesis (Christ enthroned between the Virgin and John the Baptist) on one side and a cross engraved on the other. It was once worn round one's neck and contained a small piece of paper inscribed either with a passage from the Bible or with a prayer. It was thus meant to protect its owner. Similar pieces are known to have been widely made for Christians in the Late Ottoman period.",
