    "Description": "The Roman emperors were popular subjects for cameos (small relief carvings) in antiquity, and this cameo of Vespasian (AD 9-79) imitates that tradition. Cameos of the 16th and 17th centuries imitating Roman carving were often offered to collectors as Roman artifacts.\r\n   \r\nOnyx was favored for cameos because its narrow veins of brown and white color can be carved to set off a white form against a brown background.",
