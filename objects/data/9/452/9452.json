    "Description": "This ewer, or pitcher, is decorated with scenes that encircle it in bands. Depicted on the largest band is the story from Genesis in which Melchizedek, the king of Salem, presents bread and wine to Abraham. Lot and the king of Sodom are also present, standing behind Abraham. The composition is taken from Bible woodcut illustrations by Bernard Salomon published in 1553. The band above, with cavorting, fanciful animals turning into musical instruments, is unrelated but equally effective at drawing the eye around the ewer.",
