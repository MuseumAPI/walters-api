    "Description": "M\u00fcller happened to be born in Dresden, but was, in fact, of Austrian parentage.  A government stipend enabled M\u00fcller to attend the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle, where he was profoundly impressed by the paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Fromentin. In 1873-1874, he visited Egypt. Subsequently dividing his time between studios in Cairo and Vienna, he more fully immersed himself in Arab culture than did most of his European colleagues. He painted five oil sketches of this girl named Nasleh. Such studies done from life, which he called his \"Studienkopfe,\" were intended to serve as preparatory works for his larger paintings.",
