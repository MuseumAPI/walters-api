    "Description": "A group of stem cups gifted to the museum in 1983 by Mrs. P. R. Lyne represent a series of porcelains for use on a Buddhist altar. Three of the cups date to the reign of Qianlong (1735-1795) and are identical to a cup of the same period from the original collection of William T. and Henry Walters [WALTERS 49.147]. \r\n\r\nPainted in underglaze cobalt blue are Tibetan letters mounted above lotus blossoms and surrounded by foliated patterns that coil around each character. The underside of the cup that proceeds the bell shaped foot is painted with stylized lotus petals atop a keyfret of geometric spirals. Beaded tassels dangle down the sides of the everted foot. A band of Ruyi heads, heart shaped motifs resembling the head of the curved ruyi scepter carried by Buddhist deities and symbolic of monastic authority, rest on a ring at the base of the foot. The Buddhist symbolism and imagery suggest the use of these cups in ceremony and as altar items. \r\n\r\nThe emperor of the Qianlong reign (1736-96) was a great patron of the arts, commissioning and supporting production of monumental, literary, and domestic works. Blue and white porcelain of this period draws from Xuande (1425-35) wares and exhibits a crisp and controlled elegance of decoration. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt. The kilns of Jingdezhen were the center for export and Imperial blue and white porcelain.\r\n",
