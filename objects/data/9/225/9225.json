    "Description": "Walking with the left leg in advance and the head turned to the right, raising the garment with the left hand. The right hand may have held a bow. The turn at the hips is crudely expressed; the back of the figure is shapeless and lacking in detail. The biceps are well developed. The face is flat, with a chin too short, but has finely wrought features. The upper eyelid extends over the lower at the outer corner. The costume is a sort of \"peplos\" with a bib on the front, formed by folding the garment at the top. The bib is incomplete at the left. A narrow belt encircles the waist. The hair falls in a mass at the back, with two locks falling over the left shoulder, but none over the right; hair is visible on the forehead under the corners of the helmet. The legs, right arm, and part of the helmet are missing.\r\n\r\nThis figure may well have filled the space below the arch which connected the legs of a tripod. Similar figures were found on the Acropolis at Athens: \"Mon. Ant.,\" vii (1897), cols. 306f.; De Ridder, \"Bronzes sur l'Acropole,\" p. 327 ff., nos. 815-817.",
