    "Description": "Saint Catherine stands with her left hand raised. Her right hand is extended downward and has been drilled, probably to accommodate a lost attribute. She wears a crown and a pearl necklace; next to her right leg a portion of her spiked wheel can be seen. Her bodice, with its scalloped edge, is reminiscent of the fanciful medievalizing of the 19th-century Troubadour style. Several barbs are missing from the wheel, and her crown is severely chipped. She is missing the fifth finger on her left hand and part of her left foot. Her head has been reattached.",
