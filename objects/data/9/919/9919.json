    "Description": "Cuyp specialized in careful likenesses of the middle class in the town of Dordrecht, in the southern part of Holland. His clients were less interested in innovation than in a sober conservative style that matched their own lives. By 1645, this kind of starched \"millstone\" collar was distinctly old fashioned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the artist signed and dated this work, the sitter is identified only by his age in a Latin inscription reading, \"As I am at age 67.\"\r\n",
