    "Description": "This trumpet shaped vase with a bulge in the center is one of a pair that composes the outer pieces to a mantle garniture. All three elements of the garniture are an example of export porcelain to Europe. The two surrounding vases are decorated in a similar fashion, depicting figures divided in pointed arch frames in underglaze cobalt blue painting. This is often referred to as the Lange Eleizen pattern, or \"Tall Gal\". \r\n\r\nThe uppermost figures represented are The Eight Taoist Immortals, identified by the emblems that they carry with them as they stand on scrolling clouds. Beneath them are pairs of women seated on either side of potted flowers. Between two chevron bands is a bulge in the porcelain body painted with women standing in front of fences and more potted flowers. The lowest group of framed figures includes more women, posing with instruments or dancing with more fences in the background. In the empty spans of each arch rest floral sprays. All three elements of the garniture are an example of export porcelain to Europe, depicting leisure as well as traditional religious imagery. The Dutch market received plentiful shipments of specifically crafted export porcelain with the assistance of the East India Trading Company. \r\n\r\nBlue and white porcelain was popularized in China by the Mongol emperors during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). Trade along The Silk Road meant access to Middle Eastern imports, including Persian and Central Asian cobalt ore that facilitated the porcelain production from the 14th to the early 15th century. Domestic sources of cobalt ore, including the vibrant Buddha Head blue, replaced or were mixed with the expensive imported cobalt.\r\n",
