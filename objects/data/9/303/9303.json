    "Description": "This Psalter was made for Franciscan use in Cologne in the late thirteenth century. It was owned in the late fifteenth or sixteenth century by the Augustinian nuns of St. Cecilia in Cologne, who added the calendar, the Breviary texts, prayers, and the Collect at the end. The manuscript is written in Latin and in the Ripuarisch dialect spoken in the Cologne region. The style of the historiated initials, as well as that of the bar borders topped with grotesques, closely resembles the style of Walters Ms. W.41 and of the two graduals made for the Franciscans of Cologne in 1299 by Johannes von Valkenburg (Cologne, Diozesanbibliothek, Ms. 1B, and Bonn, Universitatsbibliothek, Ms. 384). It is a well-preserved example of High Gothic illumination in Cologne.",
