    "Description": "Henrietta Maria (1609-1669) was the daughter of King Henry IV of France and the sister of Louis XIII.  In 1625, she married King Charles I of England.  She urged her husband to protect Catholics in England, which was then officially Protestant.  After Charles's downfall and execution in 1649, the queen lived chiefly in France, even after the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660.\r\n\r\nThe widowed queen wears the ropes of pearls, along with a crucifix in diamonds or rock crystal with pearls that demonstrated the magnificence expected for formal portraits of royalty in the mid 1600s.\r\n",
