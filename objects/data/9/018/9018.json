    "Description": "Christ was brought before the people by Pontius Pilate, who addressed the crowd: \"'Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no case against him.' So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, 'Here is the man!' [Ecce Homo]\" (John 19:4-5).\r\n\r\nLuca Giordano took pride in his ability to emulate the styles of others. In this work, he has imitated the woodcuts of the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528) as demonstrated by the costumes and grotesque facial features of the crowd. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this panel, please see the essay by Morten Steen Hansen in Masterpieces of Italian Painting in the Walters art Museum, ed. by M. S. Hansen and J. Spicer (London:  Giles Limited, for the Walters Art Museum, 2005), no. 41.\r\n\r\nThis painting is the companion to one of similar style showing Pilate Washing his Hands, now in the John G. Johnson collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (no. 29): the two pictures were separated only in 1900. There are also two paintings in the National Gallery in Naples (no. 84417 and 84408) that are old copies of the Walters panel and its companion in Philadelphia.",
