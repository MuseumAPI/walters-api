An area framed by engraved foliage has been left blank for a family coat of arms, implying that the piece was never sold. The Courtaulds were Huguenots, or French Protestants, who were forced to flee France and settle in London after Louis XIV issued the Edict of Nantes in 1685. In 1746, Samuel inherited the silversmithing business of his father Augustine Courtauld.",
