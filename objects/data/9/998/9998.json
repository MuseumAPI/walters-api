    "Description": "Portraits of children of noble houses were often commissioned to be sent to distant relatives.  Even though the style of sleeves with a pattern of slits for easy movement and the painting style appear to be Italian, such a painting could have been made for relatives in northern Europe\u2013for example, sent by the mother to her sister married into a distant noble family who might otherwise never \"see\" her nephew. This is one of three known versions, the other two probably earlier and possibly executed in Northern Europe, suggesting that the boy was from an important family. Sons were critical to maintaining the family line of inheritance and therefore status.",
