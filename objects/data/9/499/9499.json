    "Description": "Here is a five-storied pagoda which in general form is very much like the famous 7th-century one at Horyu-ji near Nara, underneath which relics of the Buddha were originally deposited. But it is a pagoda transformed, hardly a straightforward model. On each story are doors and drawers; the pagoda has turned into a cabinet. Images transform every surface into something it never was and never could be. Steel, gold, silver, and black lacquer have been combined to make vibrant pictures of a sort that might be seen on the painted sliding doors of large interior rooms. On each story there are views of such attractions as Mt. Fuji, the Itsukushima Shrine, and the Kiyomizu Temple, while the roofs bear images that suggest the skies above: butterflies, phoenixes, geese, plovers, herons, and peacocks.",
