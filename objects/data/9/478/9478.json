It dates to the late 10th century AH/AD 16th or early 11th century AH/AD 17th. The text narrates the fate of a man who, escaping from a wild camel, jumps into a well. There his predicament grows even more precarious when he lands on the heads of 4 snakes, grasps in desperation at a bush gnawed by two rats, and looks down to see dragon waiting to devour him should he fall.",
