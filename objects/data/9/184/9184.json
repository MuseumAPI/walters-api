    "Description": "This is a small priming spoon fits inside a hole to the left of the breech of the Ottoman rifle (Walters 51.84) which is part of the so called \"Turkish Hunting Set.\" The shaft of the spoon is silver gilt mounted with five emeralds and capped with diamonds. The bowl of the spoon is carved from a translucent bluish stone that may be an emerald or sapphire. Like the small cleaner for the flash-pan and lock (Walters 51.89), there may have been a tassel or pull ribbon connected to the object. This spoon was used to place powder into the flash-pan of the rifle before firing.",
