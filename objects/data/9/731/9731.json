    "Description": "This unusual statuette of a standing male stands out from the comparable pieces by its larger size. It is made of solid cast bronze or a copper alloy. The man stands with the right leg forward and clenched fists. He wears a short kilt and a very simple wig, which does not show evidence of any decoration. The smoothed surface does not fail to reveal the delicate and careful modeling of the thick lips and wide open eyes, with the head placed on a short stubby neck typical of the early Middle Kingdom date. The torso with a bipartite division. The feet have stubs with a sign of breakage. The stubs originally held the statuette in place on its base.",
