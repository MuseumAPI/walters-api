    "Description": "Dor\u00e9 worked as a painter, illustrator, and sculptor, but his international reputation rests mainly on his illustrations for such popular publications as Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" (1861-68), Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (1863), and Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\" (1883).\r\n\r\nHere, he depicts his brother \u00c9mile, who was a colonel in the French artillery. A visit to London in 1868 may have resulted in Dor\u00e9's decision to use delicate washes in the manner of the British watercolorists rather than opaque colors.",
