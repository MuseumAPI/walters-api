    "Description": "A priest and a peasant argue with an army officer who may be requisitioning supplies from the unwilling donors. The costumes suggest that the scene is set during the reign of Napoleon I (reigned 1804-15).\r\n\r\nA specialist in military subjects, Edouard D\u00e9taille recorded both battles and scenes of life during peace time. He drew from his own experiences as a soldier during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71).",
