    "Description": "Mummy bandages were in use from the Late through the Ptolemaic period, ca. 6th-2nd centuries BC. They were usually decorated with spells and sometimes vignettes from the \"Book of the Dead\" in order to deliver the desired magical protection for the deceased. The practice of placing inscribed bandages directly on the body of the dead person was essential to securing a good life for the deceased in the Netherworld.\r\n\r\nThis small strip of fabric is woven of high-quality linen and belongs to the well-known object group of inscribed mummy bandages. The originally light beige linen is now discolored to a darker brown. Both side ends of the bandage are lost and irregularly torn off. The original length is unknown, but might have extended to \u00be of an Egyptian cubit (= 39.15 cm = 15 3/8 in.). The inscription is composed in hieratic script and rendered in black ink (made of soot mixed with gelatin, gum, and bee wax); the color has slightly faded. The text consists of three lines; the beginnings and ends of the sentences are missing; but the losses seem to be minor judging by content and grammar.",
