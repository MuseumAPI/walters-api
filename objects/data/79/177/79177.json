    "Description": "Henry Somm (Fran\u00e7ois Cl\u00e9ment Sommier) was a serious painter who participated in the impressionist exhibitions organized by the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel between 1879 and 1889. He supported himself, however, by illustrating popular French humor magazines. Although he was extremely talented, as is apparent in this sketch, he has been overlooked by posterity, partly because his subjects were of transitory interest.",
