    "Description": "While a student of the great painter of the French Revolution Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), Granet was assigned a studio in an old convent. He became acutely aware of the changing patterns of light and shadow on the building's interior walls and continued to record such phenomena during the rest of his career. His paintings of dramatically lighted ecclesiastical architecture were much admired by his colleague from the southern town of Aix-en-Provence, Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839-1906).",
