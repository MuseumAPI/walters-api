    "Description": "Along with figurines, flutes and whistles were one of the most common artifacts made by ancient Pre-Columbian artists, and they are found in every culture, from the earliest times. This Tairona example closely resembles objects of other mediums (like gold), which are not whistles and depict winged figures. Such whistles are still used among the Kogi people of Columbia, who descended from the Tairona, and the wing forms may refer to shamanic flight.",
