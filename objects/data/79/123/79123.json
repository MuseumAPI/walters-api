    "Description": "A distinctive type of Etruscan pottery known as \"bucchero,\" made from the mid-7th century through the 6th century BC, is one of the few types of fine ancient pottery that is unpainted. The ware is recognized by its glossy black finish, resulting from a firing process in which the amount of oxygen in the kiln was minimized (known as reduction). This process makes the pottery black all the way through, unlike Greek works with a black surface. Made in the workshops of Chiusi, pottery known as \"bucchero pesante\" (\"heavy bucchero\") is distinguished by bold, imaginative shapes and abundant molded and incised decoration. The dome-shaped lid with rooster finial of this example has clearly been influenced by earlier Villanovan works.",
