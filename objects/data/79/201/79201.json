    "Description": "As a mature artist, Maril was an abstract painter, but his visions were thoroughly grounded on visual experience. A contemplative artist, balancing intuition with intellect, he recreated on canvas what he had seen, eliminating all but his subject's barest essentials. \r\n\r\nAlthough this drawing anticipates the artist's mature style in its simplification of forms, it is an early work and one that expresses his interest in cubism.",
