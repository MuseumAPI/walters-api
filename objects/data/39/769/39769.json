    "Description": "Christ is dead on a tall cross highlighted with gold. On his right, the penitent thief, tied on a cross made of a branching tree trunk, bends towards Christ. On Christ's left, the unrepentant thief bound to a similar cross, averts his face in anguish. At the foot of the cross of Christ are the skull and bones of Adam. Mary Magdalene clasps the shaft of the cross with her left hand and with her right wipes her streaming eyes. The Virgin Mary, her arms crossed on her chest, is supported by St. John, and with them stands another Mary, clasping her hands. The mounted Centurion points with his lance to Christ, and a foot-soldier in Roman armor extends his left arm toward him. Near them are another rider and a foot-soldier who wears a feathered helmet. In the middle-distance, on the left, are two soldiers and a party of riders and people walking. In the background beyond a stream is Jerusalem and castle-topped hills.",
