    "Description": "According to the Greek legend, Meleager invited the greatest hunters of Greece to join him hunting the giant wild boar which was terrorizing the countryside of Aaldeonia. The beautiful huntress Atalanta was the first hit the boar with her arrow and Meleager finished him off. The painter's adaptation of the exciting mysterious world of ancient Greece is complmented by the addition of suspension loops in the shape of dragons. Italian tin-glazed earthenware is known as maiolica because the Spanish cermaics that inspired the Italian tradtion came through the island of Majorca.",
