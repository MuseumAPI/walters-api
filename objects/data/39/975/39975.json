    "Description": "A servant girl has been found asleep by an older couple. Beside her, on a table covered with a checked cloth, is an unplucked dead goose and a large stoneware pitcher; at her feet waits a hungry cat beside a large copper basin. The artist has enriched the kitchen setting with such details as the broken mirror and the ceramic vase suspended from wall pegs, a large wooden-slatted bird-cage, and a wainscot of Delft tiles.\r\n\r\nThis painting illustrates the domestic genre practiced by Leys' master F. de Braekeleer and by Leys himself, early in his career. Paul Mantz cited a Flemish kitchen scene by Leys, dated 1841, \"M. Henri Leys,\" in the \"Gazette des Beaux-Arts,\" 20 (1866):249. Another \"Interieur flamand,\" dated 1836, was sold at the John Wilson Sale, Paris, March 14-16, 1881, no. 168.",
