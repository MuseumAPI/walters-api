    "Description": "This triptych, or tripartite icon, represents one of the most popular themes of East Christian religious art, called in Greek \"Deesis\". Following an arrangement first developed in Byzantium, Christ is shown in the center as the Judge of the Second Coming. Named in the accompanying inscription \"Lord, Ruler of the Universe\", he holds an open Gospel book. The Virgin (on his right) and John the Baptist (on his left) turn towards him with hands raised in prayer on behalf of the icon's pious beholder.",
