    "Description": "The gold necklace is composed of four braided chains. They are gathered together and, after passing through two large beads, cross over to the opposite bead where the ends are secured. The ends of the chains are fitted through holes crudely punched into the sides of the beads and are fastened by buttons inside. The overlapping chains give the impression that part of the necklace has eight chains. The length of the necklace can be adjusted by sliding the chains through the beads, thereby altering the amount of overlap. The beads are faceted and ornamented with rosettes, palmettes, and scallop shells. Collars keep the open ends from fraying.",
