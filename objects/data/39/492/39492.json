    "Description": "This flower vase is covered in a light peach bloom glaze and flaunts a variety of colors. A uniform pearly pink ground speckled softly with more pink is freckled with brown transmuted spots on the shoulders and clouded with light green on the straight neck. The body resembles the bulbous shape of a round apple. The foot bears the spurious reign mark of Xuande (1426-35).The technique of peach bloom glazes dates to the reign of Kangxi (1662-1772), invented through attempts to revive the red glazes of Ming dynasty emperors Xuande or Chenghua. Kangxi period copper-red wares with a spurious reign mark of Xuande were a moderately common occurrence. \r\n\r\nWhile the French term peau de p\u00eache (\"peach skin\") has influenced the English interpretation of the glaze as emulating a ripened peach, Chinese interpretation of the spotted red-green surface favors the apple with descriptions such as ping-kuo hong (\"apple red\") and pingguo jing (\"apple green\"). The glaze's spotted and clouded appearance required the innovative technique of blowing a copper-oxide glaze onto a clear glaze; it would then be trapped by a second layer of transparent glaze. As a result of inconsistent application of copper, areas which are thicker penetrate the most superficial glaze allowing the copper to oxidize and form green clouds. The pinkish-red spotting is also a result of a blown-on glaze.   \r\n",
