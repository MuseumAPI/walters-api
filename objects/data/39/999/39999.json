    "Description": "This fragment of a border strip with nude female figures floating in the sea or clouds has a distinct ground plane on the lower edge. The figures overlap and intertwine in a casual manner, one floating on a ball-like representation of a cloud or wave. The heads and other parts of two figures are missing, and only a leg of the third survives. \r\n\r\nThe left edge is the original end of the plaque, and the elbow of the first figure is intentionally cut. Strokes of the carving tool are still visible. While the forms are quite casually rendered, the surface has been polished.",
