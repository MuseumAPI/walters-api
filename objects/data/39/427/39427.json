    "Description": "This view into a Venetian courtyard shows people engaged in everyday activities, such as a woman washing clothes. The focus of the painting, however, is on the beauty of the decaying architecture and the rich tonal variations of the shaded walls. Architectural painting of the 18th century typically represented monumental vistas of grand buildings, but, in this work, Guardi has found a different kind of beauty by painting a building from its back side. Guardi's paintings combine a sense of place with a lightness of touch that suggest the potential romance and adventure around every corner. They were particularly popular with British visitors on the Grand Tour, for whom such views served as charming souvenirs.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this painting, please see Federico Zeri's 1976 catalogue no. 455, pp. 567-568.",
