    "Description": "This bottle shaped vase with wide neck has a body of white porcelain, decorated with cobalt blue in floral designs beneath a faintly crackled glaze. Branches of pomegranate trees are filled with bursting fruits that reveal their seeds. Bands of floral motifs cover the neck, broken apart by a geometric keyfret at the center. Stylized lotus flowers rise up the neck towards a flared mouth. The raised foot rim is painted with repeated overlapping triangles beneath a register of curling scroll decorations. Outline and wash technique is employed to provide varied shades of cobalt blue to the floral motifs and decorative elements. Dots of rich pigment are applied generously on the pomegranate branches, fruits, and leaves. These dots may be an attempt in replicating the painting style of the preceding Ming dynasty. \r\n\r\nThe year 1683 during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) marks the return of the Imperial production of porcelain and the reinstitution of the Imperial kilns at Jingdezhen. A revival of imperial blue and white porcelain in the Qing dynasty resulted in superbly crafted porcelains with well combined body, glaze, cobalt pigment, and skillful decoration. Refined blue cobalt allowed for adventurous and varied painting techniques. The Manchu emperors of the Qing were also interested in traditional Chinese culture and sought to emulate the blue and white porcelain of the Ming and Song dynasties.  \r\n",
