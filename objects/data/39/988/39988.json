    "Description": "The central role of writing in Islamic societies led to calligraphy becoming the most important visual art form. Portable pen cases (Turkish: divit) were made with great care and became objects of art themselves. Examples from the Ottoman lands are characterized by pronounced end pieces with an inkwell and a tubular arm that held the pens. Such pieces were often hinged and had a metal loop for attachment to a belt. The yatate and divit elevated pen cases to the status of wearable works of art. This object bears the tughra of Ahmad III (r. 1703-1730).",
