    "Description": "The identical silver filigree frame on these three portraits (including 38.209 and 38.516) indicates that they are a unit, possibly a family. Nevertheless, the man's portrait was probably by a different hand than that responsible for the women's. The loose, spirited execution of the man's hair and softer modeling point to the influence of more progressive developments in life-size portraiture, in contrast to the tighter modeling and conservative dress in the portraits of the women.",
