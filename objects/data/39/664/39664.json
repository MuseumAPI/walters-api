    "Description": "This miniature shows a woman in light chemise-like dress in a landscape. To the right is small building with a classical portico. The woman wears a fur lined wrap and pearl earrings. Her high hair style perhaps indicates that this painting dates from the late 1820s or 1830s. It has been suggested that the miniature depicts Marguerite Georges (1787-1867), a great beauty and noted actress who was Napoleon's mistress at the time he was First Consul.  Plane metal on the reverse with loop for hanging.",
