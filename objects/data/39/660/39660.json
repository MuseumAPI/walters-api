    "Description": "In 1603 a Portuguese carrack, the Santa Caterina, was captured by the Dutch in the Straits of Malacca and its cargo was sold at auction in Amsterdam on August 15th, 1604. Aboard the carrack was blue and white Chinese porcelain that became known in Dutch as kraakporselein and is now referred to as Kraak Porcelain. This bowl is one such example, a similar representation of this type of bowl appearing in a Dutch still-life painting by Isaac Soreau [WALTERS 37.1902].  \r\n\r\nThis bowl is decorated with six panels of long legged deer against formalized foliage. Deer were believed to live to a very great age and symbolized longevity. It was also thought that they were the only animal capable of finding the sacred fungus of longevity and immorality lingzhi. The inside is painted with simplified peach motifs, also symbols for longevity, and a deer at the center. \r\n\r\nTrading and exchange between China and the Portuguese began after Manuel I established an embassy at Beijing in 1517. From then on, blue and white porcelain was exported to Portugal and more broadly Europe. Chinese wares produced specifically for the purpose of export also included personal commissions. During the reign of Wanli (1573-1619), the kilns of Jingdezhen that produced export and Imperial wares were exploited for economic reasons with increased demand for export porcelain to Europe and Japan. \r\n",
