    "Description": "Although it cannot be archaeologically deomonstrated, it is possible that Phayao was the site of one of the earliest Thai principalities of the far north.  In the 3rd quarter of the 15th century, a prince named Yuthitsathian, from the Sukhothai region, became governor.  It was perhaps he who was responsible for introducing to Phayao a stonecarving tradition related to that of Ayutthaya.  The exact relationship of this small head to these currents is not known.",
