    "Description": "The teeth on each side of this comb vary in number and thickness. At the top of the pierced central triangular area a double-headed eagle holding a scepter and a sword is delineated under the triple-lobed crown, surmounted by an orb and cross of the Holy Roman Empire. Beneath the eagle is the name \"Michael Bauer,\" set amid the scroll foliage between a towered gateway on the right and what appears to be a gate and cross on the left. Pentagonal pierced zones occupy each corner. The date \"1778\" is carved in the top zone, the initials \"IL\" in the left corner and \"BS\" together with \"IK\" at the right. The central section has been colored green and red, with a slight tinge of gold on the imperial crown and gateway.",
