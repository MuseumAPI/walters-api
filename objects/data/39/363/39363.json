    "Description": "This type of two handled kovsh (often used as a serving bowl), like the single-handled variety, was made in wood in northern Russia and throughout the Scandinavian countries. Such a large object was surely made as a presentation piece. \r\n\r\nThe sides of this kovsh have enameled panels imitating lobes of the kind found on many silver bowls. Each contains a stylized floral design in multi-colored enamel. Vari-colored cabochon stones are set in the floral ornament forming the border. The two handles with amethysts set in them are supported by winged cockerels.",
