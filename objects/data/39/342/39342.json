    "Description": "One of the most common types of Langobardic jewelry, the basket earring derives its name from the hemispherical \"basket\" of gold wire or basket-like dome of sheet gold on its hoop. The front disk of gold is inlaid with gold wire cells to hold glass pastes arranged in the shape of a cross. Between the arms of the cross are four gold bosses decorated with gold granules. There also are beads of gold granulation creating a border around the circumference of the front disk.  At the bottom of the disk is a gold wire loop for the suspension of a pendant. On the back, the sheet-gold basket has a cruciform pattern of incised circles. The repetition of the cross motif on this earring suggests Christian Langobard patronage. The loop is circular and has gold pseudo-filigree. Unusual features of the earring include the hinge on the loop for the suspension of the disk and basket and the hinged pendant loop.",
