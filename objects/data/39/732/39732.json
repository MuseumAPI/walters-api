    "Description": "The subject is taken from the ancient historian Herodotus, who describes how King Candaules of Lydia caused his own downfall by letting Gyges see his wife, Queen Nyssia, naked. Although she did not let Candaules know, Nyssia was so outraged that she demanded that Gyges murder her husband in revenge. Here, Gyges has just been shot with one of Cupid's arrows to show that the sight of the queen made him fall in love.",
