    "Description": "Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard, better known by his pseudonym J. J. Grandville, honed his craft by drawing vignettes and illustrations for newspapers, including \"La Silhouette,\" \"L'Artiste,\" \"La Caricature,\" and \"Le Charivari.\" Some of these were printed daily, requiring tremendous powers of invention from the artists they employed. Grandville's early work allied his precise draftsmanship with a keen caricaturist's eye. This drawing was made for a lithographic frontispiece for a piece of sheet music, \"Une Course d'Omnibus\" (A Trip on the Omnibus) by Charles Henri Plantade (1764-1839).",
