    "Description": "At the age of 14, the German-born Meyer was taken to London, where he studied with Christian F. Zincke, a specialist in painting in enamel on copper. In 1764, he became painter in miniature to Queen Charlotte and painter in enamel to King George III.\r\nFrederick was the second eldest child, and second son, of George III. Later in life he was given a high rank in the army, but proved to be an ineffectual commander, inspiring the nursery rhyme \"The grand old Duke of York...\". The Walters Art Museum also holds a portrait miniature by the same artist depicting Frederick's elder brother, George, later George IV (accession number 38.53). The frame is the same as for this miniature.\r\n",
