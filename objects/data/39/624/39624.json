    "Description": "The prince, at the age of seventeen, is shown half-length, his face framed in long curls and turned three-quarters to the left. He wears armor, over which is a falling linen collar with square ends edged with wide lace and fastened by a cord with tasseled ends. The collar covers the upper part of a scarf thrown over the right shoulder. In the right upper corner appears a coat-of-arms quartered in eight: 1: Hungary; 2: Anjou-Sicily; 3: Jerusalem; 4: Aragon; 5: Anjou (modern); 6: Brabant; 7: Guelderland; 8: Bar; over all: Lorraine. The crest is a closed ducal coronet. \r\n\r\nThe portrait is after an early engraving by the Dutch artist Abraham de Blois. The subject was born in 1643. He succeeded his uncle, Charles IV, as Duke of Lorraine in 1675 under the name of Charles V. He died in 1690.",
