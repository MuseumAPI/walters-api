Because the Walters owns or has jurisdiction over the objects in its collection and owns or customarily obtains the rights to any imaging of its collection objects, it has adopted the Creative Commons Zero: No Rights Reserved or CC0 license to waive copyright and allow for unrestricted use of digital images and metadata by any person, for any purpose. The longer text descriptions about the artworks on this website are released under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Exceptions to the CC0 license may apply to works of art that are under the Walters' temporary jurisdiction, such as loaned works, and works that are not in the public domain due to age. The policy governing the CC0 license does not apply to works protected by artists' copyright, by privacy rights, or that are otherwise restricted. In these cases, the Walters can only provide a small derivative image that meets the fair-use guidelines as outlined by the Association of Art Museum Directors.

The information necessary for the proper citation of the Walters' works can be found on the object records of our online catalog. Properly citing works from the Walters collection and providing an image credit to “The Walters Art Museum,” when using images of the collection helps to steward the collection by connecting the museum with images of the works it maintains.

The Walters' CC0 license applies to digital images of works in the Walters Art Museum, archive, and library collections that are believed to be in the public domain and free of other restrictions, and are made available through the Walters' electronic interfaces. If you have questions regarding the rights status of a work or have trouble locating specific images, please contact the Digital Resources Department at digitalresources@thewalters.org.

You are free to download and use the images and descriptions on this website under the licenses named above, but if you desire digital images at a higher resolution, for scholarly or commercial publication, please contact our photo services department.

Some of the electronic records on this site are created from historic documentation and do not necessarily reflect the Walters Art Museum's complete or current knowledge about the objects they represent. Research is ongoing, and these records are constantly being reviewed and updated. If you have information about any of these objects, please feel free to contact us at curatorial@thewalters.org.
